  description: You can also use this operation to update the contents of a message.  This operation can be used to continually extend the invisibility of a  queue message. This functionality can be useful if you want a worker role  to “lease” a queue message. For example, if a worker role calls get_messages  and recognizes that it needs more time to process a message, it can  continually extend the message’s invisibility until it is processed. If  the worker role were to fail during processing, eventually the message  would become visible again and another worker role could process it.  If the key-encryption-key field is set on the local service object, this method will encrypt the content before uploading.
