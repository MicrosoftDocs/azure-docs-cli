# Old and new Azure CLIs

There is a new CLI for Azure: the Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview), now available as a beta on [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/azure-cli).
Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview) is applicable when you use the resource manager [deployment model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/resource-manager-deployment-model).
When you use the service management deployment model, you need to contiunue to use Azure CLI.
