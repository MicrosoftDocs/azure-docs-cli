  optionalParameters:
  - name: --account-endpoint
    summary: |-
      Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.
  - name: --account-key
    summary: |-
      The Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      The Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT.
  - name: --allow-task-preemption
    summary: |-
      Whether Tasks in this job can be preempted by other high priority jobs. If the value is set to True, other high priority jobs submitted to the system will take precedence and will be able requeue tasks from this job. You can update a job's allowTaskPreemption after it has been created using the update job API.
  - name: --id
    summary: |-
      Required. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two IDs within an Account that differ only by case).
  - name: --job-manager-task-command-line
    summary: |-
      The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
  - name: --job-manager-task-environment-settings
    summary: |-
      A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --job-manager-task-id
    summary: |-
      A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
  - name: --job-manager-task-resource-files
    summary: |-
      A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: |-
      The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
  - name: --json-file
    summary: |-
      A file containing the job specification in JSON (formatted to match the respective REST API body). If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
  - name: --max-parallel-tasks
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel for the job. The value of maxParallelTasks must be -1 or greater than 0 if specified. If not specified, the default value is -1, which means there's no limit to the number of tasks that can be run at once. You can update a job's maxParallelTasks after it has been created using the update job API. Default value: -1 .
  - name: --metadata
    summary: |-
      The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
  - name: --parameters
    summary: |-
      Parameter values for a Batch job JSON template file. Can only be used with --template.
  - name: --pool-id
    summary: |-
      The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
  - name: --priority
    summary: |-
      The priority of the Job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
  - name: --required-slots
    summary: |-
      The number of scheduling slots that the Task requires to run. The default is 1. A Task can only be scheduled to run on a compute node if the node has enough free scheduling slots available. For multi-instance Tasks, this property is not supported and must not be specified.
  - name: --resource-group
    summary: |-
      The resource group of the Batch account.
  - name: --template
    summary: |-
      A Batch job JSON template file. If this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
  - name: --uses-task-dependencies
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      The flag that determines if this job will use tasks with dependencies. True if flag present.
