    description: ''
  - name: --affinity-id
    summary: Required. An opaque string representing the location of a compute node or a task that has run previously. You can pass the affinityId of a compute node to indicate that this task needs to run on that compute node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target node is busy or unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be scheduled elsewhere.
    description: ''
  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task working directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails.
    description: ''
  - name: --command-line
    summary: Required. The command line of the task. For multi-instance tasks, the command line is executed as the primary task, after the primary task and all subtasks have finished executing the coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables</a>).
    description: ''
  - name: --environment-settings
    summary: A list of environment variable settings for the task.

    description: ''
  - name: --max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit. Resource files and application packages are only downloaded again if the task is retried on a new compute node.
    description: ''
  - name: --max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
    description: ''
  - name: --resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. For multi-instance tasks, the resource files will only be downloaded to the compute node on which the primary task is executed. There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
    description: ''
  - name: --retention-time
    summary: The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.

- uid: az_batch_task_delete
  name: az batch task delete
  summary: Deletes a task from the specified job.
  description: When a task is deleted, all of the files in its directory on the compute node where it ran are also deleted (regardless of the retention time). For multi-instance tasks, the delete task operation applies synchronously to the primary task; subtasks and their files are then deleted asynchronously in the background.

- uid: az_batch_task_reactivate
  name: az batch task reactivate
  summary: Reactivates a task, allowing it to run again even if its retry count has been exhausted.
  description: Reactivation makes a task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum retry count. The task's state is changed to active. As the task is no longer in the completed state, any previous exit code or failure information is no longer available after reactivation. Each time a task is reactivated, its retry count is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for tasks that are not completed or that previously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0). Additionally, it will fail if the job has completed (or is terminating or deleting).
