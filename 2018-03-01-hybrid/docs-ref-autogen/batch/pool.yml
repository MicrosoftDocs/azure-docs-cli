  optionalParameters:
  - name: --account-endpoint
    summary: |-
      Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.
  - name: --account-key
    summary: |-
      The Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      The Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT.
  - name: --application-licenses
    summary: |-
      The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, Pool creation will fail.
  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: |-
      When creating a pool, the package's application ID must be fully qualified (/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Batch/batchAccounts/{accountName}/applications/{applicationName}). Changes to Package references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but do not affect Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10 Package references on any given Pool.
  - name: --auto-scale-formula
    summary: |-
      This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for validity before the Pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information. For more information about specifying this formula, see 'Automatically scale Compute Nodes in an Azure Batch Pool' (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/).
  - name: --certificate-references
    summary: |-
      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory. Warning: This property is deprecated and will be removed after February, 2024. Please use the [Azure KeyVault Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-certificate-migration-guide) instead.
  - name: --disk-encryption-targets
    summary: |-
      A space seperated list of DiskEncryptionTargets. current possible values include OsDisk and TemporaryDisk.
  - name: --enable-inter-node-communication
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      Whether the Pool permits direct communication between Compute Nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the Pool due to deployment restrictions on the Compute Nodes of the Pool. This may result in the Pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
  - name: --id
    summary: |-
      Required. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two Pool IDs within an Account that differ only by case).
  - name: --image
    summary: |-
      OS image reference. This can be either 'publisher:offer:sku[:version]' format, or a fully qualified ARM image id of the form '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/{imageName}'. If 'publisher:offer:sku[:version]' format, version is optional and if omitted latest will be used. Valid values can be retrieved via 'az batch pool node-agent-skus list'. For example: 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2012-R2-Datacenter:latest'.
  - name: --json-file
    summary: |-
      The file containing the pool to create in JSON format, if this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
  - name: --metadata
    summary: |-
      The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
  - name: --node-agent-sku-id
    summary: |-
      The SKU of the Batch node agent to be provisioned on compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.
  - name: --os-family
    summary: |-
      The Azure Guest OS family to be installed on the virtual machines in the pool. Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016. For more information, see Azure Guest OS Releases (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-guestos-update-matrix/#releases). Allowed values: 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - name: --os-version
    summary: |-
      The default value is * which specifies the latest operating system version for the specified OS family.
  - name: --parameters
    summary: |-
      Parameter values for a Batch pool JSON template file. Can only be used with --template.
  - name: --policy
    summary: |-
      Node placement Policy type on Batch Pools. Allocation policy used by Batch Service to provision the nodes. If not specified, Batch will use the regional policy.  Allowed values: regional, zonal.
  - name: --resize-timeout
    summary: |-
      This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
  - name: --resource-group
    summary: |-
      The resource group of the Batch account.
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    summary: |-
      The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    summary: |-
      A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Space separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. True if flag present.
  - name: --target-dedicated-nodes
    summary: |-
      The desired number of dedicated Compute Nodes in the Pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
  - name: --target-low-priority-nodes
    summary: |-
      The desired number of Spot/Low-priority Compute Nodes in the Pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
  - name: --targets
    summary: |-
      If omitted, no disks on the compute nodes in the pool will be encrypted. On Linux pool, only "TemporaryDisk" is supported; on Windows pool, "OsDisk" and "TemporaryDisk" must be specified. Space seperated target disks to be encrypted. Values can either be OsDisk or TemporaryDisk.
  - name: --task-slots-per-node
    summary: |-
      The number of task slots that can be used to run concurrent tasks on a single compute node in the pool. The default value is 1. The maximum value is the smaller of 4 times the number of cores of the vmSize of the pool or 256.
  - name: --template
    summary: |-
      A Batch pool JSON template file. If this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
  - name: --vm-size
    summary: |-
      Required. For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services Pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for Pools using Images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/).
