      Storage account key. Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token. If neither are present, the command will try to query the storage account key using the authenticated Azure account. If a large number of storage commands are executed the API quota may be hit.
  - name: --connection-string
    summary: |-
      Storage account connection string. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING.
  - name: --if-match
    summary: |-
      An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified.
  - name: --if-modified-since
    summary: |-
      Commence only if modified since supplied UTC datetime (Y-m-d'T'H:M'Z').
  - name: --if-none-match
    summary: |-
      An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. Specify the wildcard character (*) to perform the operation only if the resource does not exist, and fail the operation if it does exist.
  - name: --if-unmodified-since
    summary: |-
      Commence only if unmodified since supplied UTC datetime (Y-m-d'T'H:M'Z').
  - name: --lease-duration
    defaultValue: "-1"
    summary: |-
      Specifies the duration of the lease, in seconds, or negative one (-1) for a lease that never expires. A non-infinite lease can be between 15 and 60 seconds. A lease duration cannot be changed using renew or change. Default is -1 (infinite lease).
  - name: --proposed-lease-id
    summary: |-
      Proposed lease ID, in a GUID string format. The Blob service returns 400 (Invalid request) if the proposed lease ID is not in the correct format.
  - name: --sas-token
    summary: |-
      A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN.
  - name: --timeout
    summary: |-
      Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
- uid: az_storage_blob_lease_break
  name: az storage blob lease break
  summary: |-
    Breaks the lease, if the blob has an active lease.
  description: |-
    Once a lease is broken, it cannot be renewed. Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the blob. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.   A lease that has been broken can also be released, in which case another client may immediately acquire the lease on the blob.

    summary: |-
      Commence only if unmodified since supplied UTC datetime (Y-m-d'T'H:M'Z').
  - name: --lease-break-period
    summary: |-
      For a break operation, this is the proposed duration of seconds that the lease should continue before it is broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a break operation, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
