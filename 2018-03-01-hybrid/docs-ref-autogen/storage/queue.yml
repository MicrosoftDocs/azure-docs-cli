- uid: az_storage_queue_stats
  name: az storage queue stats
  summary: Retrieves statistics related to replication for the Queue service.
  description: It is  only available when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for  the storage account.  With geo-redundant replication, Azure Storage maintains your data durable  in two locations. In both locations, Azure Storage constantly maintains  multiple healthy replicas of your data. The location where you read,  create, update, or delete data is the primary storage account location.  The primary location exists in the region you choose at the time you  create an account via the Azure Management Azure classic portal, for  example, North Central US. The location to which your data is replicated  is the secondary location. The secondary location is automatically  determined based on the location of the primary; it is in a second data  center that resides in the same region as the primary location. Read-only  access is available from the secondary location, if read-access geo-redundant  replication is enabled for your storage account.
