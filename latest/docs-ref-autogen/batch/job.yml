  summary: Add a job to the specified account.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - name: --json-file
    summary: A file containing the job specification in JSON format. If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
  - name: --account-endpoint
    summary: 'Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.'
  - name: --account-key
    summary: 'Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.'
  - name: --account-name
    summary: 'Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT.'
  - name: --id
    summary: A string that uniquely identifies the job within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. It is common to use a GUID for the id.
  - name: --metadata
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --priority
    summary: The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
  - name: --uses-task-dependencies
    summary: The flag that determines if this job will use tasks with dependencies. True if flag present.
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
  - name: --job-manager-task-command-line
    summary: The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
  - name: --job-manager-task-environment-settings
    summary: A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --job-manager-task-id
    summary: A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager taskwithin the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
  - name: --job-manager-task-resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
  - name: --pool-id
    summary: The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
