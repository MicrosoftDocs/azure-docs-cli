  optionalParameters:
  - name: --account-endpoint
    summary: |-
      Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.
  - name: --account-key
    summary: |-
      Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT.
  - name: --allow-task-preemption
    summary: |-
      Whether Tasks in this job can be preempted by other high priority jobs. If the value is set to True, other high priority jobs submitted to the system will take precedence and will be able requeue tasks from this job. You can update a job's allowTaskPreemption after it has been created using the update job API. True if flag present.
  - name: --id
    summary: |-
      Required. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two IDs within an Account that differ only by case).
  - name: --job-manager-task-command-line
    summary: |-
      Required. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
  - name: --job-manager-task-environment-settings
    summary: |-
      Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --job-manager-task-id
    summary: |-
      Required. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.
  - name: --job-manager-task-resource-files
    summary: |-
      Files listed under this element are located in the Task's working directory. There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Space-separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of times each Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: |-
      If the Job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any Tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
  - name: --json-file
    summary: |-
      A file containing the job specification in JSON (formatted to match the respective REST API body). If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
  - name: --max-parallel-tasks
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel for the job. The value of maxParallelTasks must be -1 or greater than 0 if specified. If not specified, the default value is -1, which means there's no limit to the number of tasks that can be run at once. You can update a job's maxParallelTasks after it has been created using the update job API. Default value: -1 .
  - name: --metadata
    summary: |-
      The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --pool-id
    summary: |-
      The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
  - name: --priority
    summary: |-
      The priority of the Job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
  - name: --required-slots
    summary: |-
      The number of scheduling slots that the Task requires to run. The default is 1. A Task can only be scheduled to run on a compute node if the node has enough free scheduling slots available. For multi-instance Tasks, this property is not supported and must not be specified.
  - name: --uses-task-dependencies
    summary: |-
      Whether Tasks in the Job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. True if flag present.
- uid: az_batch_job_create(azure-batch-cli-extensions)

  - name: --job-manager-task-resource-files
    summary: |-
      A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries.

- uid: az_batch_job_delete
  name: az batch job delete
  summary: |-
    Deletes a Job.
  description: |-
    Deleting a Job also deletes all Tasks that are part of that Job, and all Job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for Task data; that is, if the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute Nodes, the Batch services deletes those Tasks' working directories and all their contents.  When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the Job to the deleting state. All update operations on a Job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the Job is being deleted.

- uid: az_batch_job_disable
  name: az batch job disable
  summary: |-
    Disables the specified Job, preventing new Tasks from running.
  description: |-
    The Batch Service immediately moves the Job to the disabling state. Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the currently running Tasks of the Job. The Job remains in the disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all Tasks have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the Job then moves to the disabled state. No new Tasks are started under the Job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a Job that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.

  description: |-
    When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled Job to the enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the Job moves to the active state, and scheduling of new Tasks under the Job resumes. The Batch service does not allow a Task to remain in the active state for more than 180 days. Therefore, if you enable a Job containing active Tasks which were added more than 180 days ago, those Tasks will not run.

    summary: |-
      Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.
  - name: --account-key
    summary: |-
      Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      Batch account name. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT.
  - name: --allow-task-preemption
    summary: |-
      Whether Tasks in this job can be preempted by other high priority jobs. If the value is set to True, other high priority jobs submitted to the system will take precedence and will be able requeue tasks from this job. You can update a job's allowTaskPreemption after it has been created using the update job API. True if flag present.
  - name: --if-match
    summary: |-
      An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
  - name: --if-modified-since
    summary: |-
      A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
  - name: --if-none-match
    summary: |-
      An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
  - name: --if-unmodified-since
    summary: |-
      A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of times each Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: |-
      If the Job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any Tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
  - name: --json-file
    summary: |-
      A file containing the job update parameter specification in JSON (formatted to match the respective REST API body). If this parameter is specified, all 'Job Arguments' are ignored.
  - name: --max-parallel-tasks
    summary: |-
      The maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel for the job. The value of maxParallelTasks must be -1 or greater than 0 if specified. If not specified, the default value is -1, which means there's no limit to the number of tasks that can be run at once. You can update a job's maxParallelTasks after it has been created using the update job API. Default value: -1 .
  - name: --metadata
    summary: |-
      If omitted, it takes the default value of an empty list; in effect, any existing metadata is deleted. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --on-all-tasks-complete
    parameterValueGroup: "noaction, terminatejob"
    summary: |-
      The action the Batch service should take when all Tasks in the Job are in the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is set to noaction. If the current value is terminatejob, this is an error because a Job's completion behavior may not be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an 'invalid property value' error response. If you do not specify this element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an error if the current value is terminatejob.
  - name: --pool-id
    summary: |-
      The id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool.
  - name: --priority
    summary: |-
      The priority of the Job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. If omitted, it is set to the default value 0.
