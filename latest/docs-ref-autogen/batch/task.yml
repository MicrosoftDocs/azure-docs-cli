  parameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --job-id
    summary: The ID of the job containing the task.
    description: ''
  - name: --affinity-id
    summary: Required. An opaque string representing the location of a Compute Node or a Task that has run previously. You can pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to run on that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target Compute Node is busy or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be scheduled elsewhere.
    description: ''
  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: The space-separated list of IDs specifying the application packages to be installed. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --command-line
    summary: The command line of the task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
    description: ''
  - name: --environment-settings
    summary: A list of environment variable settings for the task. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --json-file
    summary: The file containing the task(s) to create in JSON(formatted to match REST API request body). When submitting multiple tasks, accepts either an array of tasks or a TaskAddCollectionParamater. If this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
    description: ''
  - name: --max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
    description: ''
  - name: --max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the Task may run, measured from the time the Task starts. If the Task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may run.
    description: ''
  - name: --resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
    description: ''
  - name: --retention-time
    summary: The minimum time to retain the Task directory on the Compute Node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the Task directory and all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.
    description: ''

  name: az batch task delete
  summary: Deletes a Task from the specified Job.
  description: When a Task is deleted, all of the files in its directory on the Compute Node where it ran are also deleted (regardless of the retention time). For multi-instance Tasks, the delete Task operation applies synchronously to the primary task; subtasks and their files are then deleted asynchronously in the background.

- uid: az_batch_task_reactivate
  name: az batch task reactivate
  summary: Reactivates a Task, allowing it to run again even if its retry count has been exhausted.
  description: Reactivation makes a Task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum retry count. The Task's state is changed to active. As the Task is no longer in the completed state, any previous exit code or failure information is no longer available after reactivation. Each time a Task is reactivated, its retry count is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for Tasks that are not completed or that previously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0). Additionally, it will fail if the Job has completed (or is terminating or deleting).
