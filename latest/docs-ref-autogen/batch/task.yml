  name: az batch task create
  summary: Create a single Batch task or multiple Batch tasks.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --job-id
    summary: The ID of the job containing the task.
  - name: --affinity-info
    summary: A locality hint that can be used by the Batch service to select a compute node on which to start the new task.
  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: The space separated list of IDs specifying the application packages to be installed. Space separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
  - name: --command-line
    summary: The command line of the task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
  - name: --environment-settings
    summary: A list of environment variable settings for the task. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
  - name: --json-file
    summary: The file containing the task(s) to create in JSON format, if this parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored.
  - name: --max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
  - name: --max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.
  - name: --resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Space separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
  - name: --retention-time
    summary: The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.
  - name: --task-id
    summary: The ID of the task.
  - name: --account-endpoint
    summary: 'Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.'

    summary: 'The Batch account key. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY.'
  - name: --account-name
