    description: ''
  - name: --node-agent-sku-id
    summary: Required. The Batch Compute Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node in the Pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the Compute Node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a Compute Node agent SKU which matches the selected Image reference. To get the list of supported Compute Node agent SKUs along with their list of verified Image references, see the 'List supported Compute Node agent SKUs' operation.

    parameterValueGroup: "regional, zonal"
    summary: Node placement Policy type on Batch Pools. Allocation policy used by Batch Service to provision the nodes. If not specified, Batch will use the regional policy.
    description: ''
  - name: --resize-timeout
    summary: This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    summary: Required. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    summary: Files listed under this element are located in the Task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the StartTask to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any Tasks on the Compute Node. If true and the StartTask fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the StartTask up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the StartTask is still running; and even if the StartTask fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is true. True if flag present.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-dedicated-nodes
    summary: The desired number of dedicated Compute Nodes in the Pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-low-priority-nodes
    summary: The desired number of Spot/Low-priority Compute Nodes in the Pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
    description: ''
  - name: --targets
    summary: If omitted, no disks on the compute nodes in the pool will be encrypted. On Linux pool, only "TemporaryDisk" is supported; on Windows pool, "OsDisk" and "TemporaryDisk" must be specified. Space seperated target disks to be encrypted. Values can either be OsDisk or TemporaryDisk.
    description: ''
  - name: --task-slots-per-node
    summary: The number of task slots that can be used to run concurrent tasks on a single compute node in the pool. The default value is 1. The maximum value is the smaller of 4 times the number of cores of the vmSize of the pool or 256.
    description: ''
  - name: --vm-size
    summary: Required. For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services Pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for Pools using Images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).

- uid: az_batch_pool_delete
  name: az batch pool delete
  summary: Deletes a Pool from the specified Account.
  description: 'When you request that a Pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the Pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the Pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the Pool to zero Compute Nodes; any Tasks running on existing Compute Nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize Pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the Pool is removed from the system. Because running Tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these Tasks by updating their Job to target a different Pool. The Tasks can then run on the new Pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize Pool explicitly to shrink the Pool to zero size before deleting the Pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a Pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.'

  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: Changes to Package references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but do not affect Compute Nodes that are already in the Pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any existing Package references. If you specify an empty collection, then all Package references are removed from the Pool. If omitted, any existing Package references are left unchanged. Space-separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --certificate-references
    summary: If this element is present, it replaces any existing Certificate references configured on the Pool. If omitted, any existing Certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory. Space-separated certificate thumbprints.

  - name: --if-match
    summary: An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service exactly matches the value specified by the client.
    description: ''
  - name: --if-modified-since
    summary: A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has been modified since the specified time.
    description: ''
  - name: --if-none-match
    summary: An ETag value associated with the version of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource's current ETag on the service does not match the value specified by the client.
    description: ''
  - name: --if-unmodified-since
    summary: A timestamp indicating the last modified time of the resource known to the client. The operation will be performed only if the resource on the service has not been modified since the specified time.
    description: ''
  - name: --json-file
    summary: A file containing the pool patch parameter specification in JSON (formatted to match the respective REST API body). If this parameter is specified, all 'Pool Arguments' are ignored.
    description: ''
  - name: --metadata
    summary: If this element is present, it replaces any existing metadata configured on the Pool. If you specify an empty collection, any metadata is removed from the Pool. If omitted, any existing metadata is left unchanged. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    summary: Required. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-environment-settings
    summary: Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times the Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    summary: Files listed under this element are located in the Task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=httpurl format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the StartTask to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any Tasks on the Compute Node. If true and the StartTask fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the StartTask up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the StartTask is still running; and even if the StartTask fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is true. Specify either 'true' or 'false' to update the property.
