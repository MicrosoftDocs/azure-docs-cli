  - name: --auto-scale-formula
    summary: A formula for the desired number of compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information. For more information about specifying this formula, see 'Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool' (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/</a>).
    description: ''
  - name: --certificate-references
    summary: The list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory. Space-separated certificate thumbprints.
    description: ''
  - name: --enable-inter-node-communication
    summary: Whether the pool permits direct communication between nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false. True if flag present.
    description: ''
  - name: --id
    summary: Required. A string that uniquely identifies the pool within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two pool IDs within an account that differ only by case).
    description: ''
  - name: --max-tasks-per-node
    summary: The maximum number of tasks that can run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool. The default value is 1. The maximum value of this setting depends on the size of the compute nodes in the pool (the vmSize setting).
    description: ''
  - name: --metadata
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --resize-timeout
    summary: The timeout for allocation of compute nodes to the pool. This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-dedicated-nodes
    summary: The desired number of dedicated compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-low-priority-nodes
    summary: The desired number of low-priority compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
    description: ''
  - name: --vm-size
    summary: Required. The size of virtual machines in the pool. All virtual machines in a pool are the same size. For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/</a>). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/</a>) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/</a>). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
    description: ''
  - name: --os-family
    summary: 'Required. The Azure Guest OS family to be installed on the virtual machines in the pool. Possible values are: 2 - OS Family 2, equivalent to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. 3 - OS Family 3, equivalent to Windows Server 2012. 4 - OS Family 4, equivalent to Windows Server 2012 R2. 5 - OS Family 5, equivalent to Windows Server 2016.

    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    summary: Required. The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables</a>).
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line.  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files. When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. True if flag present.
    description: ''
  - name: --node-agent-sku-id
    summary: Required. The SKU of the Batch node agent to be provisioned on compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.

- uid: az_batch_pool_delete
  name: az batch pool delete
  summary: Deletes a pool from the specified account.
  description: 'When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size before deleting the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.'
