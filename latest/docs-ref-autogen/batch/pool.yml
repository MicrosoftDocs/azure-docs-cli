For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that directory. Space-separated certificate thumbprints.
    description: ''
  - name: --enable-inter-node-communication
    summary: Whether the Pool permits direct communication between Compute Nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the Pool due to deployment restrictions on the Compute Nodes of the Pool. This may result in the Pool not reaching its desired size.

  - name: --metadata
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the Pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space-separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --resize-timeout
    summary: The timeout for allocation of Compute Nodes to the Pool. This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-dedicated-nodes
    summary: The desired number of dedicated Compute Nodes in the Pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.

    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    summary: Required. The command line of the StartTask. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables</a>).
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the Compute Node before running the command line.  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files. When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Files listed under this element are located in the Task's working directory. Space-separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the StartTask to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any Tasks on the Compute Node. If true and the StartTask fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the StartTask up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the StartTask is still running; and even if the StartTask fails, new Tasks will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is true. True if flag present.
    description: ''
  - name: --image
    summary: "OS image reference. This can be either 'publisher:offer:sku[:version]' format, or a fully qualified ARM image id of the form '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/{imageName}'. If 'publisher:offer:sku[:version]' format, version is optional and if omitted latest will be used. Valid values can be retrieved via 'az batch pool supported-images list'. For example: 'MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2012-R2-Datacenter:latest'."
    description: ''
  - name: --node-agent-sku-id
    summary: Required. The SKU of the Batch Compute Node agent to be provisioned on Compute Nodes in the Pool. The Batch Compute Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node in the Pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the Compute Node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the Compute Node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a Compute Node agent SKU which matches the selected Image reference. To get the list of supported Compute Node agent SKUs along with their list of verified Image references, see the 'List supported Compute Node agent SKUs' operation.

- uid: az_batch_pool_delete
  name: az batch pool delete
  summary: Deletes a Pool from the specified Account.
  description: 'When you request that a Pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the Pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the Pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the Pool to zero Compute Nodes; any Tasks running on existing Compute Nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize Pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the Pool is removed from the system. Because running Tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these Tasks by updating their Job to target a different Pool. The Tasks can then run on the new Pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize Pool explicitly to shrink the Pool to zero size before deleting the Pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a Pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.'
