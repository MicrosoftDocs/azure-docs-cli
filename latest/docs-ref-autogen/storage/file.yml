    summary: |-
      Storage account connection string. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING.

  - name: --open-mode

    summary: |-
      A string that represents the snapshot version, if applicable.
  - name: --start-range
    summary: |-
      Start of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If no --end-range is given, all bytes after the --start-range will be downloaded. The --start-range and --end-range params are inclusive. Ex: --start-range=0, --end-range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.
  - name: --timeout
    summary: |-
      Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
  - name: --validate-content
    summary: |-
      If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
