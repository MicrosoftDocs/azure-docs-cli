      If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.

    summary: |-
      The file share name.
  optionalParameters:
  - name: --account-key
    summary: |-
      Storage account key. Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY.
  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token. If neither are present, the command will try to query the storage account key using the authenticated Azure account. If a large number of storage commands are executed the API quota may be hit.
  - name: --auth-mode
    parameterValueGroup: "key, login"
    summary: |-
      The mode in which to run the command. "login" mode will directly use your login credentials for the authentication. The legacy "key" mode will attempt to query for an account key if no authentication parameters for the account are provided. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_MODE.
  - name: --backup-intent --enable-file-backup-request-intent
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      Required parameter to use with OAuth (Azure AD) Authentication for Files. This will bypass any file/directory level permission checks and allow access, based on the allowed data actions, even if there are ACLs in place for those files/directories.
  - name: --connection-string
    summary: |-
      Storage account connection string. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING.
  - name: --dest
    summary: |-
      Path of the file to write to. The source filename will be used if not specified.
  - name: --disallow-trailing-dot
    defaultValue: "False"
    parameterValueGroup: "false, true"
    summary: |-
      If true, the trailing dot will be trimmed from the target URI. Default to False.
  - name: --end-range
    summary: |-
      End of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If --end-range is given, --start-range must be provided. The --start-range and --end-range params are inclusive. Ex: --start-range=0, --end-range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.
  - name: --max-connections
    defaultValue: "2"
    summary: |-
      Maximum number of parallel connections to use.
  - name: --no-progress
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      Include this flag to disable progress reporting for the command.
  - name: --open-mode
    defaultValue: "wb"
    summary: |-
      Mode to use when opening the file. Note that specifying append only open_mode prevents parallel download. So, --max-connections must be set to 1 if this --open-mode is used.
  - name: --sas-token
    summary: |-
      A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN.
  - name: --snapshot
    summary: |-
      A string that represents the snapshot version, if applicable.
  - name: --start-range
    summary: |-
      Start of byte range to use for downloading a section of the file. If no --end-range is given, all bytes after the --start-range will be downloaded. The --start-range and --end-range params are inclusive. Ex: --start-range=0, --end-range=511 will download first 512 bytes of file.
  - name: --timeout
    summary: |-
      Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
  - name: --validate-content
    summary: |-
      If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
