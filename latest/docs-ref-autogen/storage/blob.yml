      Commence only if unmodified since supplied UTC datetime (Y-m-d'T'H:M'Z').
  - name: --lease-id
    summary: |-
      Required if the blob has an active lease.
  - name: --max-connections
    defaultValue: "2"
    summary: |-
      The number of parallel connections with which to download.
  - name: --name -n
    summary: |-
      The blob name.
  - name: --no-progress

      Include this flag to disable progress reporting for the command.
  - name: --open-mode
    defaultValue: "wb"
    summary: |-
      Mode to use when opening the file. Note that specifying append only open_mode prevents parallel download. So, max_connections must be set to 1 if this open_mode is used.
  - name: --overwrite
    defaultValue: "True"
    parameterValueGroup: "false, true"
    summary: |-
      Overwrite an existing file when specified. Default value is true.
  - name: --sas-token

  - name: --start-range
    summary: |-
      Start of byte range to use for downloading a section of the blob. If no end_range is given, all bytes after the start_range will be downloaded. The start_range and end_range params are inclusive. Ex: start_range=0, end_range=511 will download first 512 bytes of blob.
  - name: --tags-condition
    summary: |-
      Specify a SQL where clause on blob tags to operate only on blobs with a matching value.
  - name: --timeout
    summary: |-
      Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
  - name: --validate-content
    defaultValue: "False"
    summary: |-
      If true, calculates an MD5 hash for each chunk of the blob. The storage service checks the hash of the content that has arrived with the hash that was sent. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https, as https (the default), will already validate. Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the blob. Also note that if enabled, the memory-efficient algorithm will not be used because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.
  - name: --version-id
    summary: |-
      An optional blob version ID. This parameter is only for versioning enabled account.
- uid: az_storage_blob_download-batch

  - name: --account-name
    summary: |-
      Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token.

  - name: --auth-mode
    parameterValueGroup: "key, login"
    summary: |-
      The mode in which to run the command. "login" mode will directly use your login credentials for the authentication. The legacy "key" mode will attempt to query for an account key if no authentication parameters for the account are provided. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_MODE.
  - name: --blob-endpoint
    summary: |-
      Storage data service endpoint. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token. You can find each service primary endpoint with `az storage account show`. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT.
