Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. The sticky bit is also supported and in symbolic notation, its represented either by the letter t or T in the final character-place depending on whether the execution bit for the others category is set or unset respectively (e.g. rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwT. A rwxrw-rwx with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwt), absence of t or T indicates sticky bit not set. In 4-digit octal notation, its represented by 1st digit (e.g. 1766 represents rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit and 0766 represents rwxrw-rw- without sticky bit). For more information, please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control#levels-of-permission.

In 4-digit octal notation, its represented by 1st digit (e.g. 1766 represents rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit and 0766 represents rwxrw-rw- without sticky bit).
