  - name: --lease-duration
    defaultValue: "-1"
    summary: |-
      Specify the duration of the lease, in seconds, or negative one (-1) for a lease that never expires. A non-infinite lease can be between 15 and 60 seconds. A lease duration cannot be changed using renew or change. Default is -1 (infinite lease).
  - name: --proposed-lease-id

  name: az storage blob lease break
  summary: |-
    Break the lease, if the container or blob has an active lease.
  description: |-
    Once a lease is broken, it cannot be renewed. Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the container or blob. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.

      This is the proposed duration of seconds that the lease should continue before it is broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a break operation, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
