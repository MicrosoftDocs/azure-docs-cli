    summary: The client may specify the ETag for the entity on the request in order to compare to the ETag maintained by the service for the purpose of optimistic concurrency. The delete operation will be performed only if the ETag sent by the client matches the value maintained by the server, indicating that the entity has not been modified since it was retrieved by the client. To force an unconditional delete, set If-Match to the wildcard character (\*).
