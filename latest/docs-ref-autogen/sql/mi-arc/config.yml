- uid: az_sql_mi-arc_config_add
  name: az sql mi-arc config add
  summary: |-
    Add a value for a json path in a config file.
  description: |-
    Add the value at the json path in the config file.  All examples below are given in Bash.  If using another command line, you may need to escape quotations appropriately.  Alternatively, you may use the patch file functionality.
  status: GA
  sourceType: Extension
  syntax: >-
    az sql mi-arc config add --json-values
                             --path
  examples:
  - summary: |-
      Ex 1 - Add storage.
    syntax: az sql mi-arc config add --path custom/spec.json --json-values 'spec.storage={"accessMode":"ReadWriteOnce","className":"managed-premium","size":"10Gi"}'
  requiredParameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --json-values -j
    summary: |-
      A key value pair list of json paths to values: `key1.subkey1=value1,key2.subkey2=value2`. You may provide inline json values such as: `key='{"kind":"cluster","name":"test-cluster"}'` or provide a file path, such as `key=./values.json`. The add command does NOT support conditionals. If the inline value you are providing is a key value pair itself with `=` and `,`  please escape those characters. For example: `key1=\"key2\=val2\,key3\=val3\"`. Please see http://jsonpatch.com/ for examples of how your path should look. If you would like to access an array, you must do so by indicating the index, such as `key.0=value`.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --path -p
    summary: |-
      Path to the custom resource specification, i.e. custom/spec.json.
- uid: az_sql_mi-arc_config_init
  name: az sql mi-arc config init
  summary: |-
    Initialize the CRD and specification files for a SQL managed instance.
  status: GA
  sourceType: Extension
  syntax: az sql mi-arc config init --path
  examples:
  - summary: |-
      Initialize the CRD and specification files for a SQL managed instance.
    syntax: az sql mi-arc config init --path ./template
  requiredParameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --path -p
    summary: |-
      A path where the CRD and specification for the SQL managed instance should be written.
- uid: az_sql_mi-arc_config_patch
  name: az sql mi-arc config patch
  summary: |-
    Patch a config file based on a json patch file.
  description: |-
    Patch the config file according to the given patch file. Consult http://jsonpatch.com/ for a better understanding of how the paths should be composed. The replace operation can use conditionals in its path due to the jsonpath library https://jsonpath.com/. All patch json files must start with a key of `patch` that has an array of patches with their corresponding op (add, replace, remove), path, and value. The `remove` op does not require a value, just a path. See the examples below.
  status: GA
  sourceType: Extension
  syntax: >-
    az sql mi-arc config patch --patch-file
                               --path
  examples:
  - summary: |-
      Ex 1 - Replace the port of a single endpoint with patch file.
    syntax: >-
      az sql mi-arc config patch --path custom/spec.json --patch ./patch.json

          Patch File Example (patch.json):
              {"patch":[{"op":"replace","path":"$.spec.endpoints[?(@.name=='Controller')].port","value":30080}]}
  - summary: |-
      Ex 2 - Replace storage with patch file.
    syntax: >-
      az sql mi-arc config patch --path custom/spec.json --patch ./patch.json

          Patch File Example (patch.json):
              {"patch":[{"op":"replace","path":".spec.storage","value":{"accessMode":"ReadWriteMany","className":"managed-premium","size":"10Gi"}}]}
  requiredParameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --patch-file
    summary: |-
      Path to a patch json file that is based off the jsonpatch library: http://jsonpatch.com/. You must start your patch json file with a key called `patch`, whose value is an array of patch operations you intend to make. For the path of a patch operation, you may use dot notation, such as `key1.key2` for most operations. If you would like to do a replace operation, and you are replacing a value in an array that requires a conditional, please use the jsonpath notation by beginning your path with a $. This will allow you to do a conditional such as `$.key1.key2[?(@.key3=="someValue"].key4`.See the examples below. For additional help with conditionals, see: https://jsonpath.com/.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --path -p
