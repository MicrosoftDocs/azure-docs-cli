## June 18, 2019

Version 2.0.67

### Core

This release introduces a new [Preview] tag to more clearly communicate to customers
when a command group, command or argument is in preview status. This was previously
called out in help text or communicated implicitly by the command module version number.
The CLI will be removing version numbers for individual packages in the future. If a command is
in preview, all of its arguments are as well. If a command group is
labeled as being in preview, then all commands and arguments are considered to be in
preview as well.

As a result of this change, several command groups may seem to "suddenly" appear to be
in a preview status with this release. What actually happened is that most packages were
in a preview status, but are being deemed GA with this release

Version 2.0.0

This release of Azure CLI 2.0 is the first "Generally Available" release
General availability applies to these command modules:
- Container Service (acs)
- Compute (including Resource Manager, VM, virtual machine scale sets, Managed Disks)
- Networking
- Storage

These command modules can be used in production and are supported by standard Microsoft SLA
You can open issues directly with Microsoft support or on our [github issues list](https://github.com/azure/azure-cli/issues/)
You can ask questions on [StackOverflow using the azure-cli tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-cli),
or contact the product team at [azfeedback@microsoft.com](mailto:azfeedback@microsoft.com)
You can provide feedback from the command line with the `az feedback` command

The commands in these modules are stable and the syntax is not expected to change in upcoming releases of this version of Azure CLI

To verify the version of the CLI, use `az --version`
The output lists the version of the CLI itself (2.0.0 in this release), the individual command modules,
and the versions of Python and GCC that you're using

We also have nightly preview builds of the CLI
For information, see these instructions on [getting the nightly builds](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#nightly-builds),
and these instructions on [developer setup and contributing code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#developer-setup)

# [Beta release notes](#tab/azure-cli-beta)

## February 8, 2021

> [!NOTE]
>
>  BREAKING CHANGES are introduced in this release.  Carefully read all release notes prior to installation.
>
> The beta version does not guarantee product level quality so it should not be used in your production environment.

* Azure CLI beta internally replaces [ADAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-python) with [Azure Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity) and [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python). Existing ADAL token cache (`~/.azure/accessToken.json`) will be migrated to MSAL encrypted token cache automatically when any command requiring a credential is executed.

* There are several changes to `az login`.  (Run `az login --help` for more details.)
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] `~/.azure/accessToken.json` will no longer be created after a successful login. To get an access token, use [`az account get-access-token`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/account#az_account_get_access_token) instead.
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] `--use-cert-sn-issuer` argument is not supported.
  * After logging in with a managed identity, all `clientId`, `objectId` and `resourceId` will be shown.
  * Fix #13188: `az login` with managed identity indicating system assigned when the identity is user assigned.

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Skip SSL verification via environment `ADAL_PYTHON_SSL_NO_VERIFY` has been removed. See [work behind a proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/use-cli-effectively#work-behind-a-proxy) for trusting a self-signed root certificate.

The beta version of the Azure CLI supports all commands and will stay in sync with the current released version.  

For installation instructions, see [Install Azure CLI beta version](install-azure-cli-beta.md). 

If you find issues in the beta release, the Azure CLI engineering team welcomes your comments on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/new/choose).
