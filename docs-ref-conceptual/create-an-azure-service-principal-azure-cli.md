# Work with Azure service principal using the Azure CLI

It's important that automated tools that use Azure services always have restricted permissions. Instead of having applications sign in as a fully privileged user, Azure instead offers service principals.

## What is an Azure service principal?

An Azure service principal is an identity created to use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools. You can assign roles to the service principal in order to restrict its access. This gives you control over which resources can be accessed and at what level.
For security reasons, it's always recommended to use service principals with automated
tools rather than allowing them to sign in with a user identity.

This article shows you the steps for creating, getting information about, and resetting an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI.

## 1. Create a service principal

Create an Azure service principal with the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command.

The `appId` and `tenant` keys appear in the output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` and are used in service principal authentication. Record their values, but they can be retrieved at any point with [az ad sp list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-list).

When creating a service principal, you choose the type of sign-in authentication it uses. There are two types of authentication available for Azure service principals: [password-based authentication](./service-principal-password.md), and [certificate-based authentication](./service-principal-certificate.md) 

> [!WARNING]
> When you create an Azure service principal using the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command, the output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. As an alternative, consider using [managed identities](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) if available to avoid the need to use credentials.
>
> To reduce your risk of a compromised service principal, assign a more specific role and narrow the scopes to a resource or resource group. For more information, see [Steps to add a role assignment](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).


## 2. Get an existing service principal

A list of the service principals in a tenant can be retrieved with [az ad sp list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-list). By default this command returns the first 100 service principals for your tenant. To get all of a tenant's service principals, use the `--all` parameter. Getting this list can take a long time, so it's recommended that you filter the list with one of the following parameters:

* `--display-name` requests service principals that have a _prefix_ that match the provided name. The display name of a service principal is the value set with the `--name`
  parameter during creation. If you didn't set `--name` during service principal creation, the name prefix is `azure-cli-`.
* `--spn` filters on exact service principal name matching. The service principal name always starts with `https://`.
  if the value you used for `--name` wasn't a URI, this value is `https://` followed by the display name.
* `--show-mine` requests only service principals created by the signed-in user.
* `--filter` takes an OData filter, and performs _server-side_ filtering. This method is recommended over filtering client-side with the CLI's `--query` parameter. To learn about OData filters, see [OData expression syntax for filters](/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search).

The information returned for service principal objects is verbose. To get only the information necessary for sign-in, use the query string
`[].{id:appId, tenant:appOwnerTenantId}`. For example, to get the sign-in information for all service principals created by the currently logged in user:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp list --show-mine --query "[].{id:appId, tenant:appOwnerTenantId}"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `az ad sp list` or [az ad sp show](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-show) get the user and tenant, but not any authentication secrets _or_ the authentication method.
> Secrets for certificates in Key Vault can be retrieved with [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret#az-keyvault-secret-show), but no other secrets are stored by default.
> If you forget an authentication method or secret, [reset the service principal credentials](#6-reset-credentials).

## 3. Manage service principal roles

The Azure CLI has the following commands to manage role assignments:

* [az role assignment list](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-list)
* [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create)
* [az role assignment delete](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-delete)

The **Contributor** role has full permissions to read and write to an Azure account. The **Reader** role is more restrictive, with read-only access. For more information on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and roles, see [RBAC: Built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles).

This example adds the **Reader** role and removes the **Contributor** role:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create --assignee appID \
                          --role Reader \
                          --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName

az role assignment delete --assignee appID \
                          --role Contributor \
                          --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName
```

Adding a role _doesn't_ restrict previously assigned permissions. Since the *Contributor* rights are added by default, the role should be deleted using the command shown previously.

The changes can be verified by listing the assigned roles:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment list --assignee appID
```

You can also go into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and manually assign the role to the service principal from the IAM section of the Azure Container Registry Instance.

## 4. Sign in using a service principal

Test the new service principal's credentials and permissions by signing in. To sign in with a service principal, you need the `appId`, `tenant`, and credentials.

Sign in with a service principal with either a [password](./service-principal-password.md) or a [certificate](./service-principal-certificate.md).

To learn more about signing in with a service principal, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](authenticate-azure-cli.md).

## 5. Create a resource using service principal

The following section provides an example of how to create a resource for [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/) with a service principal, using the following commands:

* [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)
* [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)
* [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create)
* [az storage account keys list](/cli/azure/storage/account/keys#az-storage-account-keys-list)

To sign in with a service principal, you need the `appID`, `tenantID`, and `password` returned as the response when you [created your service principal](#1-create-a-service-principal).

1. Sign in as the service principal.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login --service-principal --username appID --password PASSWORD --tenant tenantID
    ```

1. Create a resource group to hold all resources used for the same quickstart, tutorial, or development project.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --location westus --name myResourceGroupName
    ```

1. Create a storage account.

    For Azure Storage, valid values for the `<KIND>` parameter are:

    * BlobStorage
    * BlockBlobStorage
    * FileStorage
    * Storage
    * StorageV2

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az storage account create --name myStorageAccountName --resource-group myResourceGroupName --kind <KIND> --sku F0 --location westus --yes
    ```

1. Get resource keys, which you use in your code to authenticate to the Azure storage account.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az storage account keys list --name myStorageAccountName --resource-group myResourceGroupName
    ```

## 6. Reset credentials

If you lose the credentials for a service principal, use [az ad sp credential reset](/cli/azure/ad/sp/credential#az-ad-sp-credential-reset). The reset command takes the same parameters
as `az ad sp create-for-rbac`.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp credential reset --name myServicePrincipal_appID_or_name
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Insufficient privileges
If your account doesn't have permission to create a service principal, `az ad sp create-for-rbac` returns an error message containing "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation." Contact your Azure Active Directory admin to create a service principal.

### Invalid tenant
If you have specified an invalid subscription ID, you see the error message "The request didn't have a subscription or a valid tenant level resource provider."  If using variables, use the Bash `echo` command to see the value being passed to the reference command.  Use [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) to change your subscription or learn [How to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI](./manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli.md).

### Resource group not found
If you have specified an invalid resource group name, you see the error message "Resource group 'name' couldn't be found."  If using variables, use the Bash `echo` command to see the value being passed to both the subscription and reference commands.  Use [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) to see the resource groups for the current subscription, or learn [How to manage Azure resource groups with the Azure CLI](./manage-azure-groups-azure-cli.md).

### Authorization to perform action
If your account doesn't have permission to assign a role, you see an error message that your account "does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write'." Contact your Azure Active Directory admin to manage roles.
