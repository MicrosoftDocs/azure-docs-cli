# Reset service principal credentials

If you ever lose your service principal credentials, the best and most secure option is to reset the credentials.
This step details how to reset your service principal credentials.

If you lose the credentials for a service principal, use [az ad sp credential reset](/cli/azure/ad/sp/credential#az-ad-sp-credential-reset). The reset command takes the same parameters
as `az ad sp create-for-rbac`.

```azurecli-interactive
# reset a service principal credential with a password
az ad sp credential reset --id myServicePrincipalID
```

```azurecli-interactive
# reset a service principal credential with a new self-signed certificate
az ad sp credential reset --id myServicePrincipalID --create-cert
```

If you don't know the ID associated with your service principal, use the `az ad sp list` command as explained in [Get an existing service principal](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-4.md).
