# 7 - Reset credentials

If you ever lose your service principal credentials, the best and most secure option is to reset the credentials.
This article details how to reset your service principal credentials.

If you lose the credentials for a service principal, use [az ad sp credential reset](/cli/azure/ad/sp/credential#az-ad-sp-credential-reset). The reset command takes the same parameters
as `az ad sp create-for-rbac`.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp credential reset --name myServicePrincipal_appID_or_name
```
