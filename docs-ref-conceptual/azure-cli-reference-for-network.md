# Azure CLI reference commands for Azure Network

The Azure Command-Line Interface ([CLI](./what-is-azure-cli.md)) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. It's available across many Azure services and gives you the ability to manage networking services from a command-line.

The Azure CLI commands for [Azure Network](/azure/networking/) are composed of two parts: **core** and **extension**. Core Azure CLI commands ship as part of the CLI and are fully supported. An extension gives you access to experimental and pre-release commands, and is automatically installed the first time you run an extension reference. For more information about extension references, see [Use extensions with Azure CLI](./azure-cli-extensions-overview.md).

See [az network](/cli/azure/network) for an alphabetic list of the Azure CLI core and extension references available for the Azure Network service. For references for each subgroup, see the tables in the following sections:

- [Virtual network](#virtual-network-references)
- [WAN and On-premise connectivity](#wan-and-on-premise-connectivity-references)
- [Load balancing and IP](#load-balancing-and-ip-references)
- [Security](#security-references)
- [Monitoring](#monitoring-references)
- [List](#list-references)

> [!NOTE]
> You're prompted to install an extension reference on first use. Or, you can use the `az extension add` command to manually install an extension.
