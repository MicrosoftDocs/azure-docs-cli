# 1 - Work with Azure service principal using the Azure CLI

Automated tools that use Azure services should always have restricted permissions, to ensure that your resources will be secure. Therefore, instead of having applications sign in as a fully privileged user, Azure offers service principals.

## Overview and Prerequisites 

An Azure service principal is an identity created for use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools, to access resources. For security reasons, it's always recommended to use service principals with automated tools rather than allowing them to sign in with a user identity.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use service principals with either password-based or certificate-based authentication in order to create a resource. The roles assigned to the service principal restrict access, which gives you control over which resources can be accessed and at what level.

This tutorial can be completed with the interactive experience offered through Azure Cloud Shell, or you may [install the CLI](install-azure-cli.md)
locally.

To create a service principal in Azure, you must have sufficient permissions to register an application with your Azure Active Directory tenant, and assign a role to the application in your Azure subscription. In order to do so, you require `Application.ReadWrite.All` permission.

[!INCLUDE [include](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

Create an Azure service principal with the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command.

The `appId` and `tenant` keys appear in the output of `az ad sp create-for-rbac` and are used in service principal authentication. Record their values, but they can be retrieved at any point with [az ad sp list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-list).

When creating a service principal, you choose the type of sign-in authentication it uses. There are two types of authentication available for Azure service principals: [password-based authentication](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-4.md), and [certificate-based authentication](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-5.md). We recommend using certificate-based authentication due to the security restrictions that password-based authentication has. To learn more about why certificate-based authentication is more secure, see the [benefits](/azure/active-directory/authentication/) that it provides, as opposed to password-based authentication.

> [!WARNING]
> When you create an Azure service principal using the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command, the output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. As an alternative, consider using [managed identities](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) if available to avoid the need to use credentials.
>
> To reduce your risk of a compromised service principal, assign a more specific role and narrow the scopes to a resource or resource group. See [Steps to add a role assignment](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) for more information.


## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to create an Azure service principal, proceed to the next step to learn how to use service principals with password-based authentication.
