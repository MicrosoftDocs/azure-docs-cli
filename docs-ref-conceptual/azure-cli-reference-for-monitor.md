# Azure CLI reference commands for Azure Monitor

The Azure Command-Line Interface ([CLI](./what-is-azure-cli.md)) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources for many Azure services. For Azure Monitor, over 100 different commands are available, which give you the ability to work effectively with the service from a command-line.

The Azure CLI commands for [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/) are composed of two parts: Azure CLI (commonly referred to as CLI **core**) and the Azure Monitor CLI footprint **extension**. The Azure CLI extension for Azure Monitor is automatically installed the first time you run the extension reference. For more information about extension references, see [Use extensions with Azure CLI](./azure-cli-extensions-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Azure Monitor now includes Application Insights and Log Analytics. You must install the extensions for each sub-area when working with the Azure CLI for Azure Monitor. You're prompted to install an extension reference on first use. Or, you can use the `az extension add` command to manually install an extension.

## Azure CLI reference examples for Azure Monitor

Examples are provided with every Azure CLI reference. Although you can also complete these tasks through the Azure portal, using the Azure CLI requires a command line. Here are a few code blocks to give you an idea of how easy it is to use the Azure CLI.

To work with Azure Monitor, you first need a resource group.  Azure resource groups are simple to create and manage with the Azure CLI.  

```azurecli
#create a resource group
az group create --location westus --name MyResourceGroup

#get a list of resource groups for a subscription
az group list --subscription MySubscription --output table
