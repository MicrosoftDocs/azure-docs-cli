# 4 - Get an existing service principal

If you already have an existing service principal that you wish to use, this article details how to retrieve your existing service principal.

A list of the service principals in a tenant can be retrieved with [az ad sp list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-list). By default this command returns the first 100 service principals for your tenant. To get all of a tenant's service principals, use the `--all` parameter. Getting this list can take a long time, so it's recommended that you filter the list with one of the following parameters:

* `--display-name` requests service principals that have a _prefix_ that match the provided name. The display name of a service principal is the value set with the `--name`
  parameter during creation. If you didn't set `--name` during service principal creation, the name prefix is `azure-cli-`.
* `--spn` filters on exact service principal name matching. The service principal name always starts with `https://`.
  if the value you used for `--name` wasn't a URI, this value is `https://` followed by the display name.
* `--show-mine` requests only service principals created by the signed-in user.
* `--filter` takes an OData filter, and performs _server-side_ filtering. This method is recommended over filtering client-side with the CLI's `--query` parameter. To learn about OData filters, see [OData expression syntax for filters](/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search).

The information returned for service principal objects is verbose. To get only the information necessary for sign-in, use the query string
`[].{id:appId, tenant:appOwnerTenantId}`. For example, to get the sign-in information for all service principals created by the currently logged in user:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp list --show-mine --query "[].{id:appId, tenant:appOwnerTenantId}"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `az ad sp list` or [az ad sp show](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-show) get the user and tenant, but not any authentication secrets _or_ the authentication method.
> Secrets for certificates in Key Vault can be retrieved with [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret#az-keyvault-secret-show), but no other secrets are stored by default.
> If you forget an authentication method or secret, [reset the service principal credentials](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-7.md).
