# 9 - Summary

## Troubleshooting

Congratulations! You learned how to create, retrieve, and work with service principals in order to create a resource group. Although you have completed the tutorial, you may still have additional questions regarding service principals that can be answered in this article.

### Insufficient privileges
If your account doesn't have permission to create a service principal, `az ad sp create-for-rbac` returns an error message containing "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation." Contact your Azure Active Directory admin to create a service principal.

### Invalid tenant
If you have specified an invalid subscription ID, you see the error message "The request didn't have a subscription or a valid tenant level resource provider."  If using variables, use the Bash `echo` command to see the value being passed to the reference command.  Use [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) to change your subscription or learn [How to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI](./manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli.md).

### Resource group not found
If you have specified an invalid resource group name, you see the error message "Resource group 'name' couldn't be found."  If using variables, use the Bash `echo` command to see the value being passed to both the subscription and reference commands.  Use [az group list](/cli/azure/group#az-group-list) to see the resource groups for the current subscription, or learn [How to manage Azure resource groups with the Azure CLI](./manage-azure-groups-azure-cli.md).

### Authorization to perform action
If your account doesn't have permission to assign a role, you see an error message that your account "does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write'." Contact your Azure Active Directory admin to manage roles.
