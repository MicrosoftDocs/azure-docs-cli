# 3 - Create a service principal using certificate-based authentication

When creating a [Service Principal](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-1.md), you can choose the either password-based or certificate based-authentication. This article details how you can use an existing **certificate** with the service principal to access the Azure Container Registry.

## Why use certificate-based authentication?

We recommend using certificate-based authentication due to the security considerations that password authentication has. Certificate-based authentication enables you to adopt a phishing resistant authentication, by using [conditional access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview), which better protects the user's assets. 

To learn more about why and how certificate based authentication is more secure, see [Azure Active Directory certificate based authentication concepts](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication). 

## How do I add certificates to a Service Principal?

We recommend you use Azure CLI to perform certificate-based authentication, however there is also a way to manually assign an existing certificate to a service principal through the Azure portal:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/concepts)

For certificate-based authentication, use the `--cert` parameter. This parameter requires that you hold an existing certificate. Make sure any tool that uses this service principal has access to the certificate's private key. Certificates should be in an ASCII format such as PEM, CER, or DER. Pass the certi897ficate as a string, or use the `@path` format to load the certificate from a file.

> [!NOTE]
> When using a PEM file, the **CERTIFICATE** must be appended to the **PRIVATE KEY** within the file.
```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalName \
                         --role roleName \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName \
                         --cert "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalName \
                         --role roleName \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName \
                         --cert @/path/to/cert.pem
```

The `--keyvault` parameter can be added to use a certificate in Azure Key Vault. In this case, the `--cert` value is the name of the certificate.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalName \
                         --role roleName \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName \
                         --cert certificateName \
                         --keyvault vaultName
```

To create a _self-signed_ certificate for authentication, use the `--create-cert` parameter:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalName \
                         --role roleName \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName \
                         --create-cert
```

You can use `--append ` to assign multiple certificates to a service principal:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp credential reset --append \
                          --name myServicePrincipalName \
                          --cert @/path/to/cert.pem
```

Console output:

```
Creating a role assignment under the scopes of "/subscriptions/myId"
Please copy C:\myPath\myNewFile.pem to a safe place.
When you run 'az login', provide the file path in the --password parameter
{
  "appId": "myAppId",
  "displayName": "myDisplayName",
  "fileWithCertAndPrivateKey": "C:\\myPath\\myNewFile.pem",
  "name": "http://myName",
  "password": null,
  "tenant": "myTenantId"
}
```

Contents of the new PEM file:
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
myPrivateKeyValue
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
myCertificateValue
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `az ad sp create-for-rbac --create-cert` command creates the service principal and a PEM file. The PEM file contains a correctly formatted **PRIVATE KEY** and **CERTIFICATE**.
The `--keyvault` parameter can be added to store the certificate in Azure Key Vault. When you use `--keyvault`, the `--cert` parameter is __required__.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalName \
                         --role roleName \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName \
                         --create-cert \
                         --cert certificateName \
                         --keyvault vaultName
```

Unless you store the certificate in Key Vault, the output includes the `fileWithCertAndPrivateKey` key. This key's value tells you where the generated certificate is stored.
__Make sure__ that you copy the certificate to a secure location, or you can't sign in with this service principal.

If you lose access to a certificate's private key, [reset the service principal credentials](./azure-cli-sp-tutorial-7.md).

## Retrieve certificate from Key Vault

For a certificate stored in Key Vault, retrieve the certificate with its private key with [az keyvault secret show](/cli/azure/keyvault/secret#az-keyvault-secret-show) and convert it to a PEM file. In the Key Vault, the name of the certificate's secret is the same as the certificate name.

```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault secret download --file /path/to/cert.pfx --vault-name VaultName --name CertName --encoding base64
openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -passin pass: -out cert.pem -nodes
```

## Convert existing PKCS12 file

If you already have a PKCS#12 file, you can convert it to PEM format using OpenSSL.  If you have a password, change the `passin` argument.

```console
openssl pkcs12 -in fileName.p12 -clcerts -nodes -out fileName.pem -passin pass:
```

## Signing in with a service principal using a certificate

To sign in with a certificate, it must be available locally as a PEM or DER file, in ASCII format. When you use a PEM file, the **PRIVATE KEY** and **CERTIFICATE** must be appended together within the file.

```azurecli-interactive
az login --service-principal --username appID --tenant tenantID --password /path/to/cert
```


# [Azure Portal](#tab/examples)

You can assign a certificate to a service principal through the Azure portal by following these steps:

1. In the Azure Portal, select Active Directory.

![Screenshot of AAD](~/docs-ref-conceptual/media/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-aad.png)

2. Then select App Registrations on the left hand sidebar.

![Screenshot of App Registration](~/docs-ref-conceptual/media/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-app-reg.png)

3. Next, select your AKS service principal.

![Screenshot of Service Principal](~/docs-ref-conceptual/media/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-select-sp.png)

4. Then proceed to click on "Certificates and secrets." Here, you can upload it, or download and install it on your PC you are using to connect with. Make sure the certificate is stored somewhere you can access it on your local machine for later steps.

![Screenshot of Upload Certificate](~/docs-ref-conceptual/media/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-cert.png)

5. To use the Service Principal with the certificate to access the Azure Container Registry, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Sign into Azure CLI with Service Principal's appID and tenantID and use certificate as password
az login --service-principal --username appID --tenant tenantID --password /path/to/cert
```

6. Then sign into the registry with `az acr login`, which uses the Active Directory token from the CLI login:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr login --name registryName
```

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate must be in PEM format - it won't work with PKCS#12 files (.p12/.pfx)
>
> You don't need to prefix the path with an @ like you do with the previous az commands
***
