# Sign into Azure interactively using the Azure CLI 

Interactive logins to Azure offer a more intuitive and flexible user experience. Interactive login
with Azure CLI allows users to authenticate to Azure directly through the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)
command, which is useful for ad-hoc management tasks and for environments that require manual
sign-in, such as those customers with multi-factor authentication (MFA). This method simplifies
access for script testing, learning, and on-the-fly management without needing to preconfigure
service principals or other noninteractive authentication methods.

## Prerequisites

* [Install the Azure CLI](./install-azure-cli.md)

## Interactive login

To sign in interactively, use the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. Beginning
with Azure CLI version [2.61.0](./release-notes-azure-cli.md#may-21-2024), Azure CLI uses Web Account Manager (WAM) on Windows, and a browser-based login on Linux and macOS by default.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

## Subscription selector

Beginning with Azure CLI version [2.61.0](./release-notes-azure-cli.md#may-21-2024), if you have
access to multiple subscriptions, you're prompted to select an Azure subscription at time of login,
as shown in the following example.

```Output
Retrieving subscriptions for the selection...

[Tenant and subscription selection]

No    Subscription name                     Subscription ID                           Tenant name
----  ------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------  --------------
[1]   Facility Services Subscription        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000      Contoso
[2]   Finance Department Subscription       00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000      Contoso
[3]   Human Resources Subscription          00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000      Contoso
[4] * Information Technology Subscription   00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000      Contoso

The default is marked with an *; the default tenant is 'Contoso' and subscription is
'Information Technology Subscription' (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Select a subscription and tenant (Type a number or Enter for no changes): 2

Tenant: Contoso
Subscription: Finance Department Subscription (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

[Announcements]
With the new Azure CLI login experience, you can select the subscription you want to use more easily.
Learn more about it and its configuration at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2271236

If you encounter any problem, please open an issue at https://aka.ms/azclibug
```

The next time you login, the previously selected tenant and subscription is marked as the default
with an asterisk (`*`) next to its number. This allows you to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the
default subscription.

Commands run against the selected subscription by default. You can still use `az account set` to
change your subscription from a command line at any time. For more information,
see [How to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI](./manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli.md).

Here are some guidelines about the subscription selector to keep in mind:

* The subscription selector is only available in 64-bit Windows, Linux, or macOS.
* The subscription selector is only available when using the `az login` command.
* You aren't prompted to select a subscription when you're logging in with a service principal or managed identity.

If want to disable the subscription selector feature, set the
[core.login_experience_v2](./azure-cli-configuration.md#cli-configuration-values-and-environment-variables) configuration property to `off`.

```azurecli-interactive
az config set core.login_experience_v2=off
az login
```

## Sign in with Web Account Manager (WAM) on Windows

Beginning with Azure CLI version [2.61.0](./release-notes-azure-cli.md#may-21-2024), Web Account
Manager (WAM) is now the default authentication method on Windows. WAM is a Windows 10+ component
that acts as an authentication broker. (An authentication broker is an application that runs on a
userâ€™s machine that manages the authentication handshakes and token maintenance for connected
accounts.)

Using WAM has several benefits:

* Enhanced security. See [Conditional Access: Token protection (preview)](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-token-protection).
* Support for Windows Hello, conditional access policies, and FIDO keys.
* Streamlined single sign-on.
* Bug fixes and enhancements shipped with Windows.

If you encounter an issue and want to revert to the previous browser-based authentication method,
set the [core.enable_broker_on_windows](./azure-cli-configuration.md#cli-configuration-values-and-environment-variables) configuration property to `false`.

```azurecli-interactive
az account clear
az config set core.enable_broker_on_windows=false
az login
```

WAM is available on Windows 10 and later, and on Windows Server 2019 and later.

## Sign in with a browser

The Azure CLI defaults to a browser-based authentication method when one of the following is true:

* The operating system (OS) is Mac, or Linux, or the Windows OS is earlier than Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019.
* The `core.enable_broker_on_windows` configuration property is set to `false`.

Follow these steps to sign in with a browser:

[!INCLUDE [interactive_login](includes/interactive-login.md)]

## Sign in with credentials on the command line

Provide your Azure user credentials on the command line. Only use this authentication method for
learning Azure CLI commands. Production-level applications should use a service principal or managed
identity.

This approach doesn't work with Microsoft accounts or accounts that have two-factor authentication
enabled. You receive an _interactive authentication is needed_ message.

```azurecli-interactive
az login --user <username> --password <password>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to avoid displaying your password on console and are using `az login` interactively,
> use the `read -s` command under `bash`.
>
> ```bash
> read -sp "Azure password: " AZ_PASS && echo && az login -u <username> -p $AZ_PASS
> ```
>
> Under PowerShell, use the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
>
> ```powershell
> $AzCred = Get-Credential -UserName <username>
> az login -u $AzCred.UserName -p $AzCred.GetNetworkCredential().Password
> ```

## Sign in with a different tenant

You can select a tenant to sign in under with the `--tenant` argument. The value of this argument
can either be an `.onmicrosoft.com` domain or the Azure object ID for the tenant. Both interactive
and command-line sign-in methods work with `--tenant`.

In select environments and beginning in Azure CLI version [2.61.0](./release-notes-azure-cli.md#may-21-2024),
you need to first disable the subscription selector by setting the `core.login_experience_v2`
configuration property to `off`.

```azurecli-interactive
# disable the subscription selector (v. 2.61.0 and up)
az config set core.login_experience_v2=off

# login with a tenant ID
az login --tenant 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

To reenable the subscription selector, run `az config set core.login_experience_v2=on`. For more information on the subscription selector, see [Interactive login](#interactive-login)

After signing in, if you want to change your active tenant,
see [How-to change your active tenant](manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli.md#change-the-active-tenant). 

## Sign in using --scope

```
az login --scope https://management.core.windows.net//.default
```

## Logout

To remove access to Azure, use the [az logout](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-logout) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az logout
```

## Clear your subscription cache

To update your subscription list, use the [az account clear](/cli/azure/account#az-account-clear)
command. You will need to sign in again to see an updated list.

```azurecli-interactive
az account clear

az login
```

Clearing your subscription cache is not technically the same process as logging out of Azure.
However, when you clear your subscription cache, you cannot run Azure CLI commands, including
`az account set`, until you sign in again.

## Refresh tokens

[!INCLUDE [refresh-token](includes/refresh-token.md)]

## Troubleshooting

When your default browser is Microsoft Edge, you might encounter the following error when attempting
to sign in to Azure interactively with `az login`: "_The connection for this site isn't secure._" To
resolve this issue, visit [edge://net-internals/#hsts](edge://net-internals/#hsts) in Microsoft

Edge. Add `localhost` under "_Delete domain security policy_" and select <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
