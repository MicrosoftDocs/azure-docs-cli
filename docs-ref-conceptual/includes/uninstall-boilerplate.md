If you decide to uninstall the Azure CLI, we're sorry to see you go. Before you uninstall, use the `az feedback` command to let us know
what could be improved or fixed. Our goal is to make the Azure CLI bug-free and user-friendly. If you found a bug, we'd appreciate it if you [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).
