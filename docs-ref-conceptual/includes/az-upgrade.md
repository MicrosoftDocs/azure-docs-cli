The CLI provides an in-tool command to update to the latest version:

```azurecli
az upgrade
```

The `az upgrade` command was added in version 2.11.0 and will not work with prior versions. This command will also update all installed extensions by default. For more `az upgrade` options, please refer to the [command reference page](/cli/azure/reference-index#az_upgrade).
