## Overview

For Linux distributions with `dnf` such as RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS, there's a package
for the Azure CLI. This package has been tested with RHEL 7.7, RHEL 8, Fedora 24 and higher, CentOS 7 and CentOS 8.

[!INCLUDE [current-version](current-version.md)]

[!INCLUDE [rpm-warning](rpm-warning.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use `yum` package manager if you are using Linux systems that don't support `dnf` package manager.

## Install

1. Import the Microsoft repository key.

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   ```

2. Create local `azure-cli` repository information.

   ```bash
   echo -e "[azure-cli]
   name=Azure CLI
   baseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/azure-cli
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/azure-cli.repo
   ```

3. Install with the `dnf install` command.

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install azure-cli
   ```

## Install specific version

You must first configure `azure-cli` repository information as shown above.

To view available versions:

```bash
dnf --showduplicates list azure-cli
```

To install specific version:

```bash
sudo dnf install azure-cli-2.29.1-1.el7
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems seen when installing with `dnf`. If you experience a problem not covered here, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).

### Install on RHEL 7.6 or other systems without Python 3

If you can, please upgrade your system to a version with official support for `python 3.6+` package. Otherwise, you need to first install a `python3` package then install Azure CLI without dependency.

You can use the following one command to install Azure CLI with `python 3.6` built from source:

```bash
curl -sL https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/rhel7_6_install.sh | sudo bash
```

You can also do it step by step:

First, Azure CLI requires `SSL 1.1+` and you need to build `openssl 1.1` from source before building `python3`:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make ncurses patch wget tar zlib zlib-devel -y
# build openssl from source
$ cd ~
$ wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1d.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf openssl-1.1.1d.tar.gz
$ cd openssl-1.1.1d
$ ./config --prefix=/usr/local/ssl --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl
$ make
$ sudo make install
# configure shared object lookup directory so that libssl.so.1.1 can be found
$ echo "/usr/local/ssl/lib" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/openssl-1.1.1d.conf
# reload config
$ sudo ldconfig -v
```

Then build Python 3 from source:

```bash
$ PYTHON_VERSION="3.6.9"
$ PYTHON_SRC_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
$ wget -qO- https://www.python.org/ftp/python/$PYTHON_VERSION/Python-$PYTHON_VERSION.tgz | tar -xz -C "$PYTHON_SRC_DIR"
$ cd $PYTHON_SRC_DIR/Python-$PYTHON_VERSION
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Finally, follow step 1 and 2 of the [install instruction](#install) to add Azure CLI repository. You can now download the package and install it without dependency.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In case you don't have the dnf download plugin installed, you will encounter command not found error on executing the below code. Use `dnf install 'dnf-command(download)'` to   install the dnf download plugin.

```bash
$ sudo dnf download azure-cli
$ sudo rpm -ivh --nodeps azure-cli-*.rpm
```

As an alternative, you can also install Python 3 through some [additional repo](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/08/13/install-python3-rhel/). Following this way, if you have set up `python3` but are still getting an error `python3: command not found` when trying to run the cli, you need to add it to your path.

```bash
$ scl enable rh-python36 bash
```

### Proxy blocks connection

[!INCLUDE[configure-proxy](configure-proxy.md)]

You may also want to explicitly configure `dnf` to use this proxy at all times. Make sure that the following
lines appear under the `[main]` section of `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`:

```dnf.conf
[main]
# ...
proxy=http://[proxy]:[port] # If your proxy requires https, change http->https
proxy_username=[username] # Only required for basic auth
proxy_password=[password] # Only required for basic auth
```

In order to get the Microsoft signing key and get the package from our repository, your proxy needs to
allow HTTPS connections to the following address:

* `https://packages.microsoft.com`

## Update

[!INCLUDE [az-upgrade](az-upgrade.md)]

You can also update the Azure CLI with the `dnf update` command.

```bash
sudo dnf update azure-cli
```

## Uninstall

[!INCLUDE [uninstall-boilerplate.md](uninstall-boilerplate.md)]

1. Remove the package from your system.

   ```bash
   sudo dnf remove azure-cli
   ```

2. If you don't plan to reinstall the CLI, remove the repository information.

   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/azure-cli.repo
   ```

3. If you don't use any other Microsoft packages, remove the signing key.

   ```bash
   MSFT_KEY=`rpm -qa gpg-pubkey /* --qf "%{version}-%{release} %{summary}\n" | grep Microsoft | awk '{print $1}'`
   sudo rpm -e --allmatches gpg-pubkey-$MSFT_KEY
   ```
