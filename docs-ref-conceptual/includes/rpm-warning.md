> The RPM package of the Azure CLI depends on the `python3` package. On your system, this may be
> a Python version which predates the requirement of Python 3.6.x. If this affects you, find a
> replacement `python3` package.
>
> Be aware that Python 2 has reached end of life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, and will no longer receive
> updates. Azure CLI has dropped support for Python 2.7 since version [2.1.0](/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli#february-18-2020).
> Newer versions of the CLI may not run correctly using Python 2.7.
