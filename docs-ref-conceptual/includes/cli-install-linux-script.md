## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> It's strongly recommend to install the CLI with a package manager. A package manager makes sure you always get the latest updates,
> and guarantees the stability of CLI components. Check and see if there is a package for your distribution before
> installing manually.

The CLI requires the following software:

* [Python 3.6.x, 3.7.x or 3.8.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/)
* [OpenSSL 1.0.2](https://www.openssl.org/source/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Azure CLI has dropped support for Python 2.7 since version `2.1.0`. Newer versions may not
> run correctly using Python 2.7.

## Install or update

Both installing and updating the Azure CLI requires re-running the install script.

```bash
curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash
```

The script can also be downloaded and run locally. You may have to restart your shell in order for the changes to take effect.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems seen during a manual installation. If you experience a problem not covered here, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).

### curl "Object Moved" error

If you get an error from `curl` related to the `-L` parameter, or an error message including the text "Object Moved", try using
the full URL instead of the `aka.ms` redirect:

```bash
curl https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/install | bash
```

### `az` command not found

If you can't run the command after installation using `bash` or `zsh`, try clearing your shell's command hash cache and check if the problem is resolved.

```bash
hash -r
```

The issue can also occur if you didn't restart your shell after installation. Make sure that the location of the `az` command is in your `$PATH`. The location
of the `az` command is

```
 <install path>/bin
```

### Proxy blocks connection

[!INCLUDE[configure-proxy](configure-proxy.md)]

In order to get the installation scripts, your proxy needs to allow HTTPS connections to the
following addresses:

* `https://aka.ms/`
* `https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/`
* `https://pypi.python.org`
* Endpoints used by your distribution's package manager (if any) for core packages

## Uninstall

[!INCLUDE [uninstall-boilerplate.md](uninstall-boilerplate.md)]

Uninstall the CLI by directly deleting the files from the location chosen at the time of installation. The default install location is the user's home directory ($HOME).

1. Remove the installed CLI files.

   ```bash
   rm -r <install location>/lib/azure-cli
   rm <install location>/bin/az
   ```

2. Modify your `$HOME/.bash_profile` file to remove the following line:

   ```text
   <install location>/lib/azure-cli/az.completion
   ```

3. If using `bash` or `zsh`, reload your shell's command cache.

   ```bash
   hash -r
   ```
