Microsoft announced in May, 2024, that it will require [MFA for all Azure users](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/microsoft-will-require-mfa-for-all-azure-users/ba-p/4140391). This announcement was followed by a June 2024 [update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/update-on-mfa-requirements-for-azure-sign-in/ba-p/4177584) that provided more information on scope and timing.

MFA will only impact Microsoft Entra ID [users](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users). It will not impact [service principals](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or [managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
