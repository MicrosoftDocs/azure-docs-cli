# Overview: Azure CLI references

Intro paragraph

## Reference types

There are three types of Azure CLI references:

1. Core references have been published as a permanent part of the Azure CLI.  
2. Extension references haven't shipped as part of the CLI but run as CLI commands. With extensions, you gain access to experimental and pre-release commands. `need better wording here`
3. Extension preview references ... `need more information here`

### Core

Either use H3s, or better, figure out a way to show how all three types work together.

### Extension

Explain what it is and why we need it

Explain how to install providing expected warning message

Explain how a single command can be both core and extension
