# Sign in with Web Account Manager (WAM) using Azure CLI

The Azure CLI now offers preview support for Web Account Manager (WAM). WAM is a Windows 10+ component that acts as an authentication broker. (An authentication broker is an application that runs on a userâ€™s machine that manages the authentication handshakes and token maintenance for connected accounts.)

Using WAM has several benefits:

* Enhanced security. See [Conditional Access: Token protection (preview)](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-token-protection).
* Support for Windows Hello, conditional access policies, and FIDO keys.
* Streamlined single sign-on.
* Bug fixes and enhancements shipped with Windows.

Signing in with WAM is a preview, opt-in feature. Once enabled, the previous browser-based user interface is replaced.

```azurecli-interactive
az config set core.allow_broker=true
az account clear
az login
```

At the current stage of development, there are a few known limitations to WAM:

* WAM is available on Windows 10 and later, and on Windows Server 2019 and later. On Mac, Linux, and earlier versions of Windows, the Azure CLI automatically defaults to a browser.  
* Microsoft Accounts (for example @outlook.com or @live.com) aren't currently supported. We're working with the Microsoft Identity team to bring the support later.
