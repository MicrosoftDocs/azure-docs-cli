# 8 - Cleanup

Now that you have completed the tutorial, it's time to clean up the created service principal resources. You can delete individual resources with the `delete` command, but the safest way to remove all resources in a resource group is with `group delete`.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroup --no-wait
```

This command deletes the resources created during the tutorial, and  clears them in the correct order. The `--no-wait` parameter keeps the CLI from blocking while the deletion takes place. If you want to wait until the deletion is complete or watch it progress, use the `group wait` command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group wait --name $resourceGroup --deleted
```
