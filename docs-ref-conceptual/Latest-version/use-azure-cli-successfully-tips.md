# Tips for using the Azure CLI successfully

Azure CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to configure and manage Azure resources from many shell environments. After you [choose your preferred shell environment](./choose-the-right-azure-command-line-tool.md#different-shell-environments) and [install the Azure CLI](./install-azure-cli.md), use this article to discover useful tips on how to avoid common pitfalls and use the Azure CLI successfully.

To learn more about specific Azure CLI commands, see the [Azure CLI Reference list](../../docs-ref-autogen/Latest-version/latest/reference-index.yml).

## Choose a scripting language

The Azure CLI is an open source _tool_ that you can run in many _scripting languages_.

* It's the scripting language that determines the quoting, escape character, and line continuation rules for Azure CLI commands.
* It can be challenging to copy Azure CLI command syntax _containing single or double quotes, escape characters, or line continuation characters_ between languages.
* **Most Microsoft documentation for the Azure CLI is written and tested in Bash.** 
* If PowerShell is your scripting language of choice, consider using the tool, [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/), which has native [PowerShell](/powershell/) scripting language functionality.

For more information on scripting language options for Azure CLI, see [Choose the right command-line tool](./choose-the-right-azure-command-line-tool.md).

## Pass values to another command

If the value is used more than once, assign it to a variable. Variables allow you to use values more than once or to create more general scripts. This example assigns an ID found by the [az vm list](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-list) command to a variable.

  ```azurecli
  # assign the list of running VMs to a variable
  running_vm_ids=$(az vm list --resource-group MyResourceGroup --show-details \
      --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id" --output tsv)

  # verify the value of the variable
  echo $running_vm_ids
  ```

If the value is used only once, consider piping. (Piping passes the output of one command as input to a second command.)

  ```azurecli
  az vm list --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].name" --output tsv | grep my_vm
  ```

For multi-value lists, consider the following options:

1. If you need more controls on the result, use a "for" loop:

  ```azurecli
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  for vmList in $(az vm list --resource-group MyResourceGroup --show-details --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id"   -output tsv); do
      echo stopping $vmList
      az vm stop --ids $vmList
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Failed to stop $vmList"
          exit 1
      fi
      echo $vmList stopped
  done
  ```

1. Alternatively, use `xargs` and consider using the `-P` flag to run the operations in parallel for improved performance:

  ```azurecli
  az vm list --resource-group MyResourceGroup --show-details \
      --query "[?powerState=='VM stopped'].id" \
      --output tsv | xargs -I {} -P 10 az vm start --ids "{}"
  ```

1. Finally, Azure CLI has built-in support to process commands with multiple `--ids` in parallel to achieve the same effect of xargs. `@-` is used to get values from the pipe:

  ```azurecli
  az vm list --resource-group MyResourceGroup --show-details \
      --query "[?powerState=='VM stopped'].id" \
      --output tsv | az vm start --ids @-
  ```

For more information on using Bash constructs with the Azure CLI including loops, case statements, if..then..else, and error handling, see [Learn to use Bash with the Azure CLI](./use-azure-cli-successfully-bash.md).

## Common update parameters

Azure CLI command groups often feature an update command. For instance, [Azure Virtual Machines](/cli/azure/vm) includes the [az vm update](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-update) command. Most update commands offer the three common parameters: `--add`, `--set`, and `--remove`.

The `--set` and `--add` parameters take a list of space-separated key-value pairs: `key1=value1 key2=value2`. To see what properties you can update, use a show command, such as [az vm show](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-show).

```azurecli
az vm show --resource-group VMResources --name virtual-machine-01
```

To simplify the command, consider using a JSON string. For example, to attach a new data disk to a virtual machine, use the following value:

```azurecli
az vm update --resource-group VMResources --name virtual-machine-01 \
--add storageProfile.dataDisks "{\"createOption\": \"Attach\", \"managedDisk\":
   {\"id\":
   \"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/yg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/yg-disk\"},
   \"lun\": 1}"
```

## Generic resource commands

A service you want to work with might not have Azure CLI support. You can use the [az resource](../../docs-ref-autogen/Latest-version/latest/resource.yml) or [az rest](./use-azure-cli-rest-command.md) commands to work with these resources.

## Concurrent execution

If you run Azure CLI commands concurrently on the same machine, write conflicts can happen if multiple Azure CLI commands write to the same Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) token cache.

To avoid potential failures, isolate the Azure CLI configuration folder for each script by setting environment variable `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` for each script to a separate directory. Azure CLI commands in that script save the configuration and token cache to the configured location instead of the default `~/.azure` folder.

### [Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=/my/config/dir
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
$env:AZURE_CONFIG_DIR='D:\my\config\dir'
```

### [Cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
set AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=D:\my\config\dir
```

---

## Asynchronous operations

Operations in Azure can take a noticeable amount of time. For instance, configuring a virtual machine at a data center isn't instantaneous. Azure CLI waits until the command finishes to accept other commands. Many commands therefore offer a `--no-wait` parameter as shown here:

```azurecli
az group delete --name MyResourceGroup --no-wait
```

When you delete a resource group, all the resources that belong to it are also removed. Removing these resources can take a long time. When you run the command with the `--no-wait` parameter, the console accepts new commands without interrupting the removal.

Many commands offer a wait option, pausing the console until some condition is met. The following example uses the [az vm wait](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-wait) command to support creating independent resources in parallel:

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group VMResources --name virtual-machine-01 --image centos --no-wait
az vm create --resource-group VMResources --name virtual-machine-02 --image centos --no-wait

subscription=$(az account show --query "id" -o tsv)
vm1_id="/subscriptions/$subscription/resourceGroups/VMResources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/virtual-machine-01"
vm2_id="/subscriptions/$subscription/resourceGroups/VMResources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/virtual-machine-02"
az vm wait --created --ids $vm1_id $vm2_id
```

After both IDs are created, you can use the console again.

## Script examples

Here are examples for using variables and looping through a list when working with Azure Virtual Machines. For in-depth examples on using Bash constructs with the Azure CLI including loops, case statements, if..then..else, and error handling, see [Learn to use Bash with the Azure CLI](./use-azure-cli-successfully-bash.md).

Use these scripts to save IDs to variables:

### [Cmd](#tab/cmd2)

```azurecli
ECHO OFF
SETLOCAL
FOR /F "tokens=* USEBACKQ" %%F IN (
   `az vm list --resource-group VMResources --show-details --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id" --output tsv`
) DO (
    SET "vm_ids=%%F %vm_ids%"  :: construct the id list
)
az vm stop --ids %vm_ids% :: CLI stops all VMs in parallel
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell2)

```azurecli
$vm_ids=(az vm list --resource-group VMResources --show-details --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id" --output tsv)
az vm stop --ids $vm_ids # CLI stops all VMs in parallel
```

---

Use these scripts to loop through a list:

### [Cmd](#tab/cmd2)

```azurecli
ECHO OFF
SETLOCAL
FOR /F "tokens=* USEBACKQ" %%F IN (
    `az vm list --resource-group VMResources --show-details --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id" --output tsv`
) DO (
    ECHO Stopping %%F
    az vm stop --ids %%F
)
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell2)

```azurecli
$vm_ids=(az vm list --resource-group VMResources --show-details --query "[?powerState=='VM running'].id" --output tsv)
foreach ($vm_id in $vm_ids) {
    Write-Output "Stopping $vm_id"
    az vm stop --ids $vm_id
}
```
