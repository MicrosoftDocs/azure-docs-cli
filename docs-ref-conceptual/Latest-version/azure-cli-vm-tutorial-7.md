# Summary of virtual machine resources

You learned how to create a VM connected to a VNet, used the `--query` and `--output` arguments to
capture data to be stored in shell variables, and looked at some resources that get created for
Azure VMs.

Where you go from here depends on what you plan to use the Azure CLI for. There are various
materials that go further in depth on the features covered in this tutorial.

## Samples

If you want to get started right away with specific tasks, look at some sample scripts.

- [A - Z list of Azure CLI samples][11]
- [Azure CLI samples GitHub repository - VMs][07]

## Get support

If you'd like to give feedback, suggestions, or ask questions about the Azure CLI, there are several
ways for you to get in touch.

- `az feedback` is a built-in command for the Azure CLI that allows providing free-form feedback to
  the team.
- For personalized support, see [Create an Azure support ticket in Azure CLI][09]
- File a feature request or a bug report for the Azure CLI in the [Azure CLI repository][08].
