# Cleanup & troubleshoot service principals

You learned how to create, retrieve, and work with service principals. Now that you completed the
tutorial, it's time to clean up the created service principal resources.

## Cleanup service principal resources

The safest way to remove all resources used in this tutorial is to use [az group delete][08]. The
`--no-wait` parameter keeps the CLI from blocking while the deletion takes place.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --no-wait
```

If you prefer, delete individual service principals with the [az ad sp delete][07] command.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp delete --id myServicePrincipalID
```

## Troubleshoot service principals

Although you completed the tutorial, you might still have questions regarding service principals
that can be answered in this section.

### Insufficient privileges

If your account doesn't have permission to create a service principal, `az ad sp create-for-rbac`
returns an error message containing "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation." Contact
your Microsoft Entra administrator to obtain `User Access Administrator` or
`Role Based Access Control Administrator` permissions.

### Invalid tenant

If you specified an invalid subscription ID, you see the error message "The request didn't have a
subscription or a valid tenant level resource provider." If using variables, use the Bash `echo`
command to see the value being passed to the reference command. Use [az account set][06] to change
your subscription or learn [How to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI][02].

### Resource group not found

If you specified an invalid resource group name, you see the error message "Resource group 'name'
couldn't be found." If using variables, use the Bash `echo` command to see the value being passed to
both the subscription and reference commands. Use [az group list][09] to see the resource groups for
the current subscription, or learn [How to manage Azure resource groups with the Azure CLI][01].

### Authorization to perform action

If your account doesn't have permission to assign a role, you see an error message that your account
"doesn't have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write'."
Contact your Microsoft Entra administrator to manage roles.

### Interactive authentication is needed

When signing in with password authentication, error message "...Interactive authentication is
needed..." occurs if your organization requires multifactor authentication. Switch to
certificate-based authentication, or consider using [managed identities][05].

### Compliant device required

If you try to create a service principal using a device that's not compliant with your
organization's access policies, you receive the message "...Conditional Access policy requires a
compliant device...". Switch to a computer that meets your organization's access policies.
