### Microsoft Installer (MSI)

#### Latest version

Download and install the latest release of the Azure CLI. When the installer asks if it can make changes to your computer, select the "Yes" box.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Latest MSI of the Azure CLI (32-bit)](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Latest MSI of the Azure CLI (64-bit)](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindowsx64)

If you have previously installed the Azure CLI, running either the 32-bit or 64-bit MSI will overwrite an existing installation.

#### Specific version

If you prefer, you can download a specific version of the Azure CLI by using a URL.
