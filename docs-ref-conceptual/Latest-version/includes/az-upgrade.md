Beginning with version [2.11.0][03], the Azure CLI provides an in-tool command to update to the
latest version.

```azurecli
az upgrade
```

This command also updates all installed extensions by default. For more `az upgrade` options, see
the [command reference page][02]. For Azure CLI versions prior to [2.11.0][03], update by
reinstalling as described in [Install the Azure CLI][01].
