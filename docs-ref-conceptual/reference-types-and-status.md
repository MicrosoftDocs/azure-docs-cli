# Overview: Azure CLI terminology and support levels

This article explains Azure CLI terminologies.  There are syntax components, reference types, and statuses.

## Azure CLI syntax components

The Azure CLI syntax is a combination of groups, references, commands, and parameters. Often the **full reference command** is referred to as **command**.

| Azure Service | Reference group | Reference subgroup(s) | Command | Full reference command | Parameter Examples
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Azure CLI | [az config](../latest/docs-ref-autogen/config.yml) | | | az config | --local, --output -o
| Azure Network | [az network](../latest/docs-ref-autogen/network.yml) | application-gateway | create | [az network application-gateway create](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway#az-network-application-gateway-create) | --name, --resource-group, --capacity
| Azure DevOps | [az pipelines](../latest/docs-ref-autogen/pipelines.yml) | agent | list | [az pipelines agent list](../latest/docs-ref-autogen/pipelines/agent.yml) | --pool-id, --agent-name, --demands

A **reference subgroup** can have multiple levels such as `az network application-gateway private-link ip-config add`

| Reference Group | Subgroup 1 | Subgroup 2 | Subgroup 3| Command|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|network|application-gateway|private-link|ip-config|add

See [Reference list A to Z](../latest/docs-ref-autogen/reference-index.yml) for a complete list of reference commands.

## What is reference type?

Azure CLI commands are either part of the **core** Azure CLI service, or they're an **extension**.  Extensions are optional add-ons.  The reference type determines the release schedule, status and installation method as described here:

| Term | Core | Extension |
| - | - | -|
| **References** | Are part of the primary Azure CLI service | Are optional reference commands that must be installed |
| **Install**    | Jointly with the [MSI installer](install-azure-cli-windows.md) | Individually with [az extension add](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-add)                 |
| **Released**   | On a schedule | As new features or updates become available |
| **Status**     | Can be GA (Generally Available), preview or deprecated | Also can be GA, preview or deprecated |

To get a list of command groups, run `az`.  For a list of extensions, use [az extension list-available --output table](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-list-available) commands.

```azurecli-interactive
# Get list of all command groups
az

# Get list of extensions
az extension list-available --output table
```

### Core

Azure CLI references that have been published as a permanent part of the CLI are called **core references**. All core references install with the Azure CLI and you can't choose a subset of references. If you run the CLI through Azure Cloud Shell, core references are always up to date.

### Extension

Extensions aren't shipped as part of the CLI but run as CLI commands. Some extensions are a permanent part of the Azure CLI, but often, an extension gives you access to preview and experimental commands. A single reference group, such as **az iot hub**, can have both core and extension commands.  Here are two examples:

|      Full reference command       | Is Core | Is Extension |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| az iot hub list                   | yes     |              |
| az iot hub job list               |         | yes          |

You're prompted to install an extension upon first use.  You can also install an extension by running the [az extension add](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-add) command.

You can learn more about extension references including installation and updating in [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](azure-cli-extensions-overview.md).  See [Available extensions for the Azure CLI](azure-cli-extensions-list.md) for a complete list of extension reference commands.

## What is reference status?

Regardless of reference type, Azure CLI references fall into three status categories: **GA** (Generally Available), **public preview** or **deprecated**. It's the reference command status (not type) that determines stability.

| | GA  | Public preview | Deprecated
|-|-|-|-|
| **Stability** | Permanent | Can change in response to customer feedback. Is subject to the terms of [Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). | Will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> Warnings indicating **public preview** or **deprecated** are part of the Azure CLI command output and should be expected.

Most commands and parameters for a single reference have a single status, but not always. A GA reference that is being built out to offer more commands can have both GA and preview reference commands. As new parameters are added to increase functionality, a single command can also have parameters that fall under different status categories. Here are example references that have different statuses:

|   Full reference command   |                              Parameters                              |   Type    | GA  | Public preview | Deprecated   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --- | -------------- | ------------ |
| az network dns zone list   | All                                                                  | Core      | yes |                |              |
| az network dns zone create | --name, --resource-group, --if-none-match, --parent-name             | Core      | yes |                |              |
|                            | --existingParameter5                                                 | Core      |     |                | yes          |
|                            | --newParameter6                                                      | Core      |     | yes            |              |
| az network vhub list       | All                                                                  | Extension | yes |                |              |
| az network vhub create     | --address-prefix, --name, --resource-group, -vwan, --location, --sku | Extension | yes |                |              |
|                            | --exsitingParameter7                                                 | Extension |     | yes            |              |
|                            | --newParameter8                                                      | Extension | yes |                |              |
| az network firewall create | All                                                                  | Extension |     | yes            |              |

The above table is only an example and **isn't** representative of the current reference statuses for `az network`.
