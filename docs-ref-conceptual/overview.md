# Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview) TEST UPDATE

There is a new CLI for Azure: the Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview), now available as a beta on [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/azure-cli).
Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview) is applicable when you use the resource manager [deployment model](/azure/resource-manager-deployment-model).
You can continue to use [Azure CLI](/azure/xplat-cli-install?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json)
with either the classic or the resource manager deployment model.

Today Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview) supports these services, with more coming online:
- Active Directory
- App Service
- Container Service
- IoT Hub
- Key Vault
- Resource manager
- Redis Cache
- Storage
- Virual Machines
- Virtual Networks

> [!Note]
> If you use both CLIs, just remember that `azure` is the old CLI - Azure CLI, and that `az` is the new CLI - Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview). 

[Get started](get-started-with-az-cli2.md) with Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview) now.
