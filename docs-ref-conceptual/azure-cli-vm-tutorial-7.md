# Summary

Congratulations! You learned how to create a VM that's connected to a VNet, used the `--query` and `--output` arguments
to capture data to be stored in shell variables, and looked at some of the resources that get created for Azure VMs.

Where you go from here depends on what you plan to use the CLI for. There are various materials that go further
in depth on the features covered in this tutorial.

## Samples

If you want to get started right away with specific tasks, look at some sample scripts.

* [A - Z list of Azure CLI samples](samples-index.md)

## Get support

If you'd like to give feedback, suggestions, or ask questions about the CLI, there are many
ways for you to get in touch.

* `az feedback` is a built-in command for the CLI that allows providing free-form feedback to the team.
* For personalized support, see [Create an Azure support ticket in Azure CLI](azure-cli-support-request.md)
* File a feature request or a bug report with the CLI in the [Azure CLI repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli).
