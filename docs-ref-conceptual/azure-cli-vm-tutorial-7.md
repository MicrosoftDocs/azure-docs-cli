# 7 - Summary

Congratulations! You learned how to create a VM that's connected to a VNet, used the `--query` and `--output` arguments
to capture data to be stored in shell variables, and looked at some of the resources that get created for Azure VMs.

Where you go from here depends on what you plan to use the CLI for. There are a variety of materials that go further
in depth on the features covered in this tutorial.

## Samples

If you want to get started right away with specific tasks, look at some sample scripts.

* Working with [Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json) and [Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/windowcli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json)
* Working with [webapps](/azure/app-service/app-service-cli-samples?toc=%2Fcli%2Fazure%2Ftoc.json) and [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functionfunctions-cli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json)
* Working with databases - [Azure SQL databases](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json), [PostgreSQL](/azurpostgresql/sample-scripts-azure-cli?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json), [MySQL](/azure/mysql/sample-scripts-azure-cli?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json), an[CosmosDB](/azure/cosmos-db/cli-samples?toc=%2fcli%2fazure%2ftoc.json).

## Get support

If you'd like to give feedback, suggestions, or ask questions about the CLI, there are a number of
ways for you to get in touch.

* `az feedback` is a built-in command for the CLI that allows providing free-form feedback to the team.
* For personalized support see [Create an Azure support ticket in Azure CLI](azure-cli-support-request.md)
* File a feature request or a bug report with the CLI in the [Azure CLI repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli).
* Ask a question or get clarification by filing an issue in the [Azure CLI documentation repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-clissues).
