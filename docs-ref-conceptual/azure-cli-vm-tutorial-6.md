# Cleanup

Now that the tutorial is complete, it's time to clean up the created resources. You
can delete individual resources with the `delete` command, but the safest way to remove all resources
in a resource group is with `group delete`.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroup --no-wait
```

This command deletes the resources created during the tutorial, and is guaranteed to deallocate
them in the correct order. The `--no-wait` parameter keeps the CLI from blocking while the
deletion takes place. If you want to wait until the deletion is complete or watch it progress, use the `group wait` command.

```azurecli-interactive
az group wait --name $resourceGroup --deleted
```

With cleanup completed, the tutorial is finished. Continue on for a summary of everything
you learned and links to resources that will help you with your next steps.
