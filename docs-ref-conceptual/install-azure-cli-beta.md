# Install Azure CLI beta version

A new beta version of the Azure CLI has been released that offers increased security for token cache, access tokens and SSL certificates.  This beta vesion can be installed in Windows, macOS and Linux environments and will stay in sync with the most recent release.

> [!NOTE]
>
>  BREAKING CHANGES are introduced in this release.  Carefully read all [release notes](/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli?tabs=azure-cli-beta) prior to installation.
>
> The beta version does not guarantee product level quality so it should not be used in your production environment.

## Understand beta changes

### `accessTokens.json` deprecation

The current Azure CLI saves the ADAL refresh tokens and access tokens to `~/.azure/accessToken.json`. Azure CLI beta uses MSAL and will no longer generate `accessTokens.json`.  Tokens will be saved to MSAL's shared token cache called `msal.cache`. 

The MSAL token cache will be encrypted on Windows, macOS and Linux with a desktop environment; therefore, directly accessing the MSAL token cache will not work. Any existing workflow depending on `accessTokens.json` will stop working.

Below are several alternatives you may consider: 

#### Calling `az account get-access-token`

You can manually call `az account get-access-token` in a terminal or use subprocess to call it from another programming language. By default, the returned token is for the default subscription/tenant shown in `az account show`.

#### Using `AzureCliCredential`

`AzureCliCredential` is a credential type in all existing language SDKs. It internally uses subprocess to call `az account get-access-token` to gets an access token from current logged in CLI accounts. 

#### Accessing shared MSAL cache

First party apps can use `SharedTokenCacheCredential` from Azure Identity SDK to directly access the shared MSAL cache.

## How to install Azure CLI beta

Azure CLI is built on [Python](https://www.python.org/). The supported Python versions are 3.6, 3.7, 3.8. On Windows, you will first need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Azure CLI beta can only be installed with `pip` from a Microsoft repository.  Use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to execute the following commands, or `python3`, depending on the Linux distribution or your installed Python version.

To avoid overwriting your installed Azure CLI, we recommend installing the beta version in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

1. Create a virtual environment

   Navigate to the folder where you want to create the virtual environment, then run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv <env_name>
   ```

1. Activate the virtual environment

   ### [Windows PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

   ```powershell
   . .\<env_name>\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

   ### [Linux/macOS Bash](#tab/bash)

   ```bash
   . <env_name>/bin/activate
   ```
   ---
   These commands can also be used to reactivate your virtual environment.

1. Install Azure CLI beta

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install --extra-index-url https://azcliprod.blob.core.windows.net/beta/simple/ azure-cli
   ```

1. Deactivate the virtual environment

   After you finish using Azure CLI beta, you can close the terminal window, or use the `deactivate` command.

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## How to uninstall Azure CLI beta

To uninstall Azure CLI beta, delete the virtual environment folder.

### [Windows PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Remove-Item -Force -Recurse <env_name>
```

### [Linux/macOS Bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
rm -rf <env_name>
```
