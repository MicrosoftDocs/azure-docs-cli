# Azure CLI release notes

> [!CHANGES]
> * "Reference group" = the first word following `az`.
> 1. Release notes are sorted by reference group and no longer by an internal source code group or description.  There will now be a direct linkable connection between our autogen reference content and our release notes.  For example:
>    - "ARM" is now (az) "deployment", or "bicep" or "resourcemanagement etc.
>    - "App Service" is now "functionapp", or "app config" or "webapp" etc.
>    - "RDBMS" is now "mysql" or "postgres" etc.
>    - "arctransfer" is now "arc"
>    - "AKS" and "aks-preview" are now "aks" for both Core and Extension release notes
> 2. Both Core and Extension command are in a single `Release Notes` doc
> 3. Core and extension release notes have been combined, but as there are no dates for extensoin releases in *.HST, I've made up values.  These dates will need to be entered manually (preferably not), extracted from Github history, or a creative option #3.
> 4. Extra `++++` that cause a line break have been removed from extension release notes
> 5. Only a sample of Core and Extension relase notes have been copied for this POC2
> 6. Source code for extension release notes are in the extension name, like [application-insights](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/main/src/application-insights/HISTORY.rst) instead of `az monitor`.  This new design would sort these release notes under `monitor` as `az application-insights` does not exist.  Extension [alertsmanagement](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/main/src/alertsmanagement/HISTORY.rst) also contains `az monitor` commands.  These release notes will need to be combined under a single `monitor` H2.
> 7. Q: If 2 extensions can contain release notes for a single reference group (like `az monitor`), does this also happen in reverse?  One extension contains > 1 reference group, like **ExtensionNameABC** contains commands for `az abc` and `az def`?

POC3 differences
- block format
- table format
- tags for command group indicating command group type (core, extension).  Can be any meaningful tag we select.
- Q: What value is there to adding a link to the GitHub release PR?

**Block example**

>[version 2.39.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/26231), August 02, 2022
> 
> - `az account list`: Add TenantId column to table output
> - [az account list](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list): Add TenantId column to table output

>[version 0.2.5](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/blob/main/src/account/HISTORY.rst#025), April 1, 2022 (Extension)
