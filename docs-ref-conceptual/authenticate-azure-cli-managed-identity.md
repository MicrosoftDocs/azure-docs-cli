# Sign into Azure with a managed identity using the Azure CLI 

On resources configured for managed identities for Azure resources, you can sign in using the managed identity.
Here are some of the benefits of using managed identities:

* You don't need to manage credentials. Credentials arenâ€™t even accessible to you.
* You can use managed identities to authenticate to any resource that supports Microsoft Entra authentication, including your own applications.
* Managed identities can be used at no extra cost.

Signing in with the resource's identity is done through the `--identity` flag.

To sign in with a system-assigned managed identity:

```azurecli-interactive
az login --identity
```

To sign in with a user-assigned managed identity, you must specify the client ID, object ID or resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity with `--username`:

```azurecli-interactive
az login --identity --username <client_id|object_id|resource_id>
```

To learn more about managed identities for Azure resources, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). 

Here are three articles showing the use of the `az login --identity` command:
