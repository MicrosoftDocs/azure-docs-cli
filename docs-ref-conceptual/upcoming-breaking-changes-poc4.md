> [!CHANGES]
> 1. Every breaking change message contains the following:
>    - Timeline
>    - Impact
>    - Concise message
>    - Next steps
>    - Pointer for additional information
> 1. Breaking changes are now grouped by command group, just like release notes
> 1. Links to release notes have been added
> 1. IMPORTANT!  We need to standardize on repeatable phrases like `for remediation...` and `Any script continuing to use this [something] will receive error ...`.

# Upcoming breaking changes in the Azure CLI - POC2

- The H3 for reference group name has been removed
- The link the release notes, previously at the bottom of each H4, has been removed
