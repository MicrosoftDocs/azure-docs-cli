# Reference documentation requirements

Before publishing a new reference group or command, meet these minimum reference and conceptual documentation requirements.

## Autogenerated reference content

One purpose of autogenerated reference content is to decrease the number of simple Quickstarts and encourage Microsoft content writers to use their abilities to teach a cross-service scenario or job to be done.  We are **not** trying to eliminate Quickstarts!  We **do want** the Azure CLI autogenerated content to be _Best in Class!_

The _/_help.py_ file contains the information that becomes the Azure CLI autogenerated content.  For engineering guideance on in-line help, see [engineering instruction doc]().

#### General guidelines

1. Develop and test all reference examples in a Bash environment.

1.  Write all help messages and resulting autogenerated reference content for the entry-level Azure CLI customer.  Assume the customer has no prior knowledge of Bash.

#### Summaries

1. Write the `short-summary` in active voice within a single sentence.  Active voice has an understood "you".  Examples:
   - **Poor:** Work with accounts.
   - **Not great:** Manage accounts.
   - **Good:** Manage Azure subscription information.  (The word "information" does not ad meaning to the sentence.)
   - **Better:** Manage Azure subscriptions.
   - **Good example:** [az eventgrid](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/eventgrid)

1. Include in the `short-summary` information that cannot be immediately deduced from the reference command name.  Examples:
   - **Poor:** Manage logic apps
   - **Not great:**  Manage Azure Logic Apps
   - **Better:** Manage automated workflows with Azure Logic Apps
   - **Good example:** [az managedapp](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/managedapp)

1. Include additional tips in the `long-summary`.  
   - Provide information customers should understand about the reference group or command.
   - This section is not the place for Quickstart or How-to guideance.  Keep your `long-summary` focused on information _about_ the command, not how to use it.
   - Use links to conceptual content judiciously.  There isn't an automated process to fix broken links in the Python source code files.
   - **Good Example:** [az network application-gateway rule create](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/rule?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-application-gateway-rule-create)]

#### Examples

1. Every reference command must have an example code block.  Remember that reference content is translated into many languages and customers are at diverse technical levels.  What is intuitive for one customer, is a frustrating roadblock for another.

1. Give special attention to `create` command examples.  These are often revenue-generating and Microsoft loses billable resources when a create command fails.

1. Create diverse, not repetitive examples.

   **Poor:**
   ```azurecli
   az some-command -g MyRG -l eastus --p1 00.0.0.0 --p2 "1.0" -- p3 "Gen1"
   ```
   ```azurecli
   az same-command -g MyRG -l eastus --p1 00.0.0.0 --p2 "1.0" --p3 "Gen2"
   ```
   
   **Better:**
   ```azurecli
   az some-command -g MyRG -l eastus --p1 00.0.0.0 --p2 "1.0" -- p3 "Gen1"
   ```
   ```azurecli
   az same-command -g MyRG -l eastus --p4 "SystemAssigned, UserAssigned" --p5 Tag1
   ```

1. Provide real-world parameter values.  These examples leaves the customer to figure out an acutal value and format for the example.
    - **Not very helpful:** az some-command -g MyRG --address-prefix MyAddressPrefix --settings MySettings
    - **Helpful:** az some-command -g MyRG --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 --settings '{ "fileUris": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-powershell-samples/master/application-gateway/iis/install_nginx.sh"],"commandToExecute": "./install_nginx.sh" }'
    
    - **Not very helpful:** az some-command -g MyResourceGroup --p1  --p2 MyIPaddress --p3 MyTargetURL -- p4 MyTypes
    - **Helpful:** az some-command -g MyResourceGroup --p1 "appgwcert.pfx" --p2 00.000.000.00 --p3 "https://bing.com" --p4 "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess"

   The challenge is that some customers will not replace actual example values.  Here is an option:
   ```azurecli
   # Replace each parameter value
   az some-command -g <MyRG> --address-prefix <MyAddressPrefix> --settings <MySettings>

   # Your syntax may look something like this:
   az some-command -g MyRG --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 --settings '{ "fileUris": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-docs-powershell-samples/master/application-gateway/iis/install_nginx.sh"],"commandToExecute": "./install_nginx.sh" }'

   ```
>[!TO DO] Confirm that code blocks with > 1 command reference do not throw a build validation error.

1. Provide examples for complex parameters or those that require a particular format.  Here are some examples:
   - **--linked-resources id**="/subscriptions/21a9967a-e8a9-4656-a70b-96ff1c4d05a0/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/accounts/mystorageacc"
   - **--start-timestamp** 100000
   - **--force-end-timestamp**=False
   - **--tracks** @C:\tracks.json
   - **--query** [?starts_with(name,'Something')]
   - **--action webhook** MyActionName \https://alerts.contoso.com apiKey={APIKey}


1. Provide examples for parameters that should be used in groups.

   When there are a significant number of parameters for a single reference command, it is confusing for customers to understand what parameters should be used together.  See the [az vm](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) reference documentation for an example of a command with many parameters.  Enter `az vm create -h` in a terminal and notice the groupings provided in the in-line help:
      - Authentication ARguments
      - Dedicated Host Arguments
      - Managed Service Identity Arguments
      - Marketplace Image Plan Arguments
      - Monitor Arguments
      - Network Arguments
      - Storage Arguments
      - Global Arguments

## Conceptual articles

Minimum viable conceptual content for the Azure CLI is one Quickstart or How-to guide for every command _group_ that contains at least one `create` command.  Easily meet this requirement using one of the these ideas:

- Copy an existing Azure portal article replacing Azure portal instructions with Azure CLI reference commands.
- Add a [conceptual tab](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help/platform/validation-ref/tabbed-conceptual?branch=main) to an existing H2.  This a good solution when there aren't enough reference commands to replicate an entire portal article
- This solution is **not preferred**, but add an H2 to the bottom of an existing article with links to related Azure CLI reference content.  This does not qualify as "conceptual content", but it's a start when you are pressed for time.
