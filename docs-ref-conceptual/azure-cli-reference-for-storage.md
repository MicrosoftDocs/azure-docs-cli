# Azure CLI for Azure Storage

The Azure Command Line Interface ([Azure CLI](./what-is-azure-cli.md)) is a set of commands you use to create and manage Azure resources. It's available across many Azure services, including Azure Storage, and gives you the ability to manage Azure Storage from a command line.

The [Azure Storage](/azure/storage) CLI experience is composed of two parts: a core and its extensions. Core Azure CLI commands ship as part of the CLI and are fully supported. Extensions give you access to experimental and pre-release commands. For more information about using extensions, see [Use extensions with Azure CLI](./azure-cli-extensions-overview.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> You're prompted to install an extension reference on first use. Or, you can use the [az extension add](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) command to manually install an extension by name.

See [Azure Storage](/cli/azure/service-page/azure%20storage) for a complete list of the Azure CLI core and extension references available for the Azure Storage service. For references for each subgroup, see the tables in the following sections:

- [Azure File Sync](#azure-file-sync)
- [Import/Export service](#importexport-service)
- [Storage accounts](#storage-accounts)
- [Storage blobs](#storage-blobs)
- [Storage containers](#storage-containers)
