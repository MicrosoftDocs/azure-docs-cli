# Use Azure CLI to manage sensitive Azure information such as keys, passwords and secrets

When you manage Azure resources, there is sensitive information that must be protected. For example, keys, passwords and connection strings can be displayed in a terminal window and written to a log file. Protect sensitive information resulting from Azure CLI commands by setting environment variables.

TODO: Note about "global settings" as right now `az config` is user-specific.

# Environment vs user configurations

TODO: This belongs in azure-cli-configuration.md

|Variable name| Variable type
|-|-|
|show_secrets_warning| system environment variable
|show_secrets| user variable
|show_secrets_allow_list | user variable
|show_secrets_duration | user variable

# Set show_secrets_warning

Beginning in Azure CLI x.y.z, a warning will display in your terminal if Azure CLI command output contains sensitive information. Turn these warnings off

# Set show_secrets

The Azure CLI `show_secrets` environment variable provides three options for protecting secrets:

- **off**: No secrets will be written to the output of the command. This is the default setting beginning in Azure CLI version x.y.z.
- **custom**: Secrets will be written in the output of commands defined by the the [show_secrets_allowlist](#create-a-show_secrets_allow_list).
- **on**: Secrets will be written in the output of all commands. This was the default behavior before Azure CLI version x.y.z.

In this example, replace `off` with your setting of choice:

```azurecli-interactive
az config set show_secrets = off
```

# Create a show_secrets_allow_list



# Set show_secrets_duration 


# Override settings for a command
