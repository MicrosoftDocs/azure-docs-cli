# Use Azure CLI to manage sensitive information

When you manage Azure resources, there's sensitive information that must be protected. For example, keys, passwords and connection strings can be created by Azure CLI commands and displayed in a terminal window. The output for some commands can also be stored in log files, This is often the case when working with GitHub actions and other DevOps runners.

It's critical to protect this information. If acquired publicly, the exposure of secrets can cause serious damage and lead to a loss of trust in your company's products and services. To help you to protect sensitive information, the Azure CLI detects secrets in the output of some reference commands, and display a warning message when a secret is identified.

## Overview

Beginning in [Azure CLI 2.57](./lease-notes-azure-cli.md#february-06-2024), a warning message displays when reference commands result in the output of sensitive information. The `2.57` Azure CLI version identifies these sensitive information types:

* Access tokens
* Storage account keys
* **{need full list}**

This list will be expanded in upcoming releases.

## Set secrets warning configuration

Turn sensitive information warnings `on` and `off` by setting the `clients.show_secrets_warning` configuration property.

```azurecli-interactive
az config set clients.show_secrets_warning=off
```

## Considerations

The purpose of the warning message is to decrease the unintentional exposure of secrets, but these messages might require you to make changes in existing scripts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new warning messages are sent to Standard Error (STDERR), not Standard Out (STDOUT).
> Therefore, if you are running an Azure CLI command that results in sensitive information output, you will need to trap for the warning message or turn warnings off using `az config set show_warnings = off`.

For example, in an Azure DevOps pipeline, if the ‘failOnStderr’ parameter is set to ‘True’ of the Bash v3 task, the warning message halts the pipeline. Consider enabling the warning message to identify if any secrets are exposed in your pipelines and then take remediation actions.

## Default behavior

Warnings are **enabled** by default in Azure Cloud Shell. If you run the Azure CLI locally through Cmd or PowerShell, warnings are **disabled** by default.
