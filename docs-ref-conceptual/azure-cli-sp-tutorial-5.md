# Manage service principal roles

In order to restrict access to your Azure service's resources, you can use a service principal to manage role assignments. Each role provides different permissions allowed by the user when accessing the service's resources.

The Azure CLI has the following commands to manage role assignments:

* [az role assignment list](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-list)
* [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create)
* [az role assignment delete](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-delete)

The **Contributor** role has full permissions to read and write to an Azure account. The **Reader** role is more restrictive, with read-only access. For more information on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and roles, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

Adding a role _doesn't_ restrict previously assigned permissions. This example adds the **Reader** role and removes the **Contributor** role:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create --assignee myServicePrincipalID \
                          --role Reader \
                          --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName

az role assignment delete --assignee myServicePrincipalID \
                          --role Contributor \
                          --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName
```

Output Console:

```
{
  "condition": null,
  "conditionVersion": null,
  "createdBy": null,
  "createdOn": "yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00.000000+00:00",
  "delegatedManagedIdentityResourceId": null,
  "description": null,
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "name": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "principalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "principalType": "ServicePrincipal",
  "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "scope": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
  "updatedBy": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "updatedOn": "yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00.000000+00:00"
}
```

The changes can be verified by listing the assigned roles:

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment list --assignee myServicePrincipalID
```

You can also go into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and manually assign the role to the service principal from the IAM section of the Azure Container Registry Instance.  For more information on role assignments, see [Steps to add a role assignment](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to manage your service principal roles, proceed to the next step to learn how to use service principals to create a resource.
