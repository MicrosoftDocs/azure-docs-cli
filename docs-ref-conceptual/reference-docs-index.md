# Azure CLI conceptual article list

This article provides an A - Z list of published content for each Azure CLI reference group. Use these links to find tested code snippets and scripts that show the use of parameter values for different tasks. For common Azure CLI commands, like `az group`, only the most popular articles have been listed.

With over 9,000 reference commands, not every Azure CLI command has been used in Azure published content. For a complete list of Azure CLI commands, see the [A - Z reference list](/cli/azure/reference-index). For a list of Azure CIL samples, see [Azure CLI sample scripts](samples-index.md)
