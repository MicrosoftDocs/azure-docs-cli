  - isRequired: true
    name: --pool-id
    summary: |-
      The ID of the Pool that contains the Compute Node. Required.
  optionalParameters:

      Batch service endpoint. Alternatively, set by environment variable: AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT.

  - name: --container-url
    summary: |-
      The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the Batch Service log file(s).
