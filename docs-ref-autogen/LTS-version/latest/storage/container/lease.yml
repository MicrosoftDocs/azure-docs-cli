  summary: |-
    Break the lease, if the container has an active lease.
  description: |-
    Once a lease is broken, it cannot be renewed. Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the container. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.
