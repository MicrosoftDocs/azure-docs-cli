    If you do not specify a $filter clause including a poolId, the response includes all Pools that existed in the Account in the time range of the returned aggregation intervals. If you do not specify a $filter clause including a startTime or endTime these filters default to the start and end times of the last aggregation interval currently available; that is, only the last aggregation interval is returned.
