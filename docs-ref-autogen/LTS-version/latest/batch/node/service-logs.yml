  requiredParameters:
  - isRequired: true
    name: --node-id
    summary: |-
      The ID of the Compute Node from which you want to upload the Azure Batch service log files.
  - isRequired: true
    name: --pool-id
    summary: |-
      The ID of the Pool that contains the Compute Node.
  optionalParameters:
