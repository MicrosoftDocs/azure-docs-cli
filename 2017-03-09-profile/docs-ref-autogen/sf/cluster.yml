  summary: Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster.
  langs:
  - azurecli
  parameters:
  - name: --applications-health-state-filter
    summary: Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the result of cluster health query based on their health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match the filter are returned. All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned. - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  - name: --events-health-state-filter
    summary: Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned. - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
  - name: --nodes-health-state-filter
    summary: Allows filtering of the node health state objects returned in the result of cluster health query based on their health state. The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of nodes with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned. - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState.
