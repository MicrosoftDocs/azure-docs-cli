  summary: Deletes the specified message.
  description: 'Normally after a client retrieves a message with the get_messages operation,  the client is expected to process and delete the message. To delete the  message, you must have two items of data: id and pop_receipt. The  id is returned from the previous get_messages operation. The  pop_receipt is returned from the most recent get_messages() or  update_message() operation. In order for the delete_message operation  to succeed, the pop_receipt specified on the request must match the  pop_receipt returned from the get_messages() or update_message()  operation.'

  summary: Retrieves one or more messages from the front of the queue, but does not alter the visibility of the message.
  description: Only messages that are visible may be retrieved. When a message is retrieved  for the first time with a call to get_messages, its dequeue_count property  is set to 1. If it is not deleted and is subsequently retrieved again, the  dequeue_count property is incremented. The client may use this value to  determine how many times a message has been retrieved. Note that a call  to peek_messages does not increment the value of DequeueCount, but returns  this value for the client to read.

  summary: Adds a new message to the back of the message queue.

- uid: az_storage_message_update
  name: az storage message update
  summary: Updates the visibility timeout of a message.
  description: You can also use this operation to update the contents of a message.  This operation can be used to continually extend the invisibility of a  queue message. This functionality can be useful if you want a worker role  to “lease” a queue message. For example, if a worker role calls get_messages  and recognizes that it needs more time to process a message, it can  continually extend the message’s invisibility until it is processed. If  the worker role were to fail during processing, eventually the message  would become visible again and another worker role could process it.
