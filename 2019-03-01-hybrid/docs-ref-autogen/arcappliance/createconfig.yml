IP address prefix is entered as the subnet's IP address range for the virtual network and subnet mask (IP Mask) in CIDR notation (ex: 192.168.7.1/24). An IP Subnet CIDR calculator can be used for this. Example: For IPs within a subnet range of 192.168.7.1 - 192.168.7.254, the IP address prefix is 192.168.7.1/24. Within 192.168.7.1/24, set k8snodeippoolstart (appliance VM IP) to 192.168.7.2, k8snodeippoolend (upgrade VM IP) to 192.168.7.3 and control plane IP to 192.168.7.4.

Example: For a subnet range of 192.168.7.1 - 192.168.7.254, the IP address prefix is 192.168.7.1/24.

  - name: --ipaddressprefix
    summary: |-
      Arc resource bridge requires 3 IP addresses for the on-premises appliance VM (appliance VM IP, upgrade VM IP, control plane IP). All IPs should reside within the same subnet and fall within the range specified in the IP address prefix. IP address prefix is entered as the subnet's IP address range for the virtual network and subnet mask (IP Mask) in CIDR notation (ex: 192.168.7.1/24). An IP Subnet CIDR calculator can be used for this. Example: For IPs within a subnet range of 192.168.7.1 - 192.168.7.254, the IP address prefix is 192.168.7.1/24. Within 192.168.7.1/24, set k8snodeippoolstart (appliance VM IP) to 192.168.7.2, k8snodeippoolend (upgrade VM IP) to 192.168.7.3 and control plane IP to 192.168.7.4.
  - name: --k8snodeippoolend
    summary: |-
      Arc resource bridge on-premises appliance VM requires 2 IP addresses (appliance VM IP & upgrade VM IP) that should reside within the same subnet and fall within the range specified in the IP address prefix. IP addresses are specified as an IP range with a minimum size of 2 IP addresses. This parameter is to specify the end range IP. Example: For a subnet range of 192.168.7.1 - 192.168.7.254, the IP address prefix is 192.168.7.1/24. Within 192.168.7.1/24, set k8snodeippoolstart (appliance VM IP) to 192.168.7.2, k8snodeippoolend (upgrade VM IP) to 192.168.7.3 and control plane IP to 192.168.7.4.

metadata:
  description: This command features two modes - interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode provides helpful prompts that explain the parameter and what to pass. It is initiated by passing only the required parameters. Non-interactive mode allows you to pass all the parameters needed to create the configuration files without being prompted.
